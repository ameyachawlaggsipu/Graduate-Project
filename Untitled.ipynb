       "'Background\\r\\nStimulant medications for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can reduce appetite.\\r\\nHow Common is It?\\r\\nAbout ⅓ of adult and paediatric patients report reduced appetite with stimulant medications. \\r\\nStimulants taken in the morning may end up reducing appetite, such that the person has a poor appetite for breakfast, lunch and even dinner. \\r\\nAs the medication wears off later in the day, they may have a much larger appetite later. \\r\\nIn most patients, this effect is temporary and/or is not very significant. In some cases, this may be a good thing. \\r\\nIn other cases, the loss of appetite can be a problem. \\r\\nThe good news is that there are things that can be done to deal with this. \\r\\nGuidance for Caregivers/Patients\\r\\nDo try to be patient and wait things out, as the appetite and weight often improves on its own over a few months. \\r\\nConsider monitoring your child’s height and weight.\\r\\n●      It can be helpful to measure your child’s height and weight in order to see how they are growing. You can share this information with the healthcare provider.  \\r\\nDo consider doing these meal time and food strategies in the meanwhile: \\r\\n●      Is there an issue with getting enough calories? If so, then consider increasing the number of calories through increasing fat (not through increasing sugar) ○      Instead of skim milk, serve homo milk. ○      Instead of low fat yoghourt, serve higher fat yoghourt.\\r\\nDon’ts\\r\\nStrategies\\r\\nMealtime strategies in general\\r\\nWhen to Eat? \\r\\n●      Try to have regular meal times, such as 8 AM, 12 PM, 5 PM, along with snacks between meals. \\r\\n\\r\\n●      Be mindful if the child starts eating so much at snacks that they lose appetite for meals however. \\r\\nWhat to Eat? \\r\\n●      Offer foods that are high-calorie and healthy at the same time. ●      Whole milk (rather than skim milk). ●      High fat yogurt●      Cheese ●      At snack time, consider salty snacks (e.g. salted nuts which are high calorie) which will make your child thirsty, then give them whole milk (as opposed to juice). \\r\\n ●      Avoid the usual things we might give an adult trying to lose weight, such as rice cakes, low-fat milk or yogurt, celery sticks, etc. \\r\\n\\r\\n●      Encourage higher calorie foods (yet still healthy) such as whole-grain breads, high calorie vegetables such as sweet potatoes, etc. \\r\\n\\r\\n●      If you want to serve vegetables such as celery and carrots, consider serving in a high-calorie dip such as mayonnaise; or cook the celery and carrots in a soup to make them easier to consume. \\r\\n\\r\\n●      Try to avoid junk food (e.g. chocolate bars, processed junk foods) as this can increase other problems, e.g. diabetes, etc.  \\r\\n●      Give your child food first during mealimes, and provide drinks later. With some children, drinking liquids before eating will reduce the amount of food that they eat. \\r\\nHow to Eat? \\r\\n●      Does your child have hyperactivity or trouble sitting still at the table? If so, then do allow your child to move and fidget. Consider special ‘mobility’ seating (such as the wedge cushion) which allows your child to sit and yet still move at the table. Or allow them to stand at the table. Ask them to fetch things for people. \\r\\n●      Break food down into smaller portions. Kids with ADHD can get overwhelmed with large tasks, and it is recommended to break large tasks into smaller ones. For a similar reason, they may feel overwhelmed at seeing a whole sandwich that they have to eat, thus consider cutting the sandwich into smaller sizes, e.g. four pieces. Instead of serving a whole fruit, cut into smaller pieces. \\r\\n\\r\\n●      Ensure food is visually appealing. Kids with ADHD tend to be visual, so it helps to ensure foods are visually appealing. Interestingly enough, eating colourful fruits and vegetables is also healthy. The colour for fruits and vegetables comes from phytochemicals. The most colourful fruits and vegetables are those that are the richest in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.\\r\\nDon’ts\\r\\n●      Don’t get into stressful conflicts about eating. Is your child getting upset or stressed out about eating? ●      Try to give them time and space to calm down. Instead of giving them a command, “You have to eat”, try making a less pressuring comment, e.g. “Food is ready! It\\'s always so much more delicious when its warm.”\\r\\n●      Don’t punish by denying them food.\\r\\nWhat about distracted eating, e.g. eating with the TV on?\\r\\n●      In general, many experts argue against “mindless” eating. On the other hand, if you have tried other strategies and your child is struggling with low intake, then consider trying it out. E.g. give them healthy snacks to munch on while distracted. \\r\\nStrategies Over a Typical Day \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n  \\r\\n  Morning \\r\\n  \\r\\n  \\r\\n     \\r\\n  \\r\\n  Breakfast   (BEFORE taking medications) such as \\r\\n●        Eggs ●        Whole milk ●        Cereal such as granola (with   calories from good fats such as almonds, nuts), oatmeal with cream ●        Yoghurt  ●        Troubles eating solid   foods?  Consider liquid breakfast (such   as homemade smoothies; diluting yogurt with milk; Breakfast Carnation Drink,   Boost, etc.).  \\r\\n              \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n  \\r\\n  \\r\\n  \\r\\n  \\r\\n     \\r\\n  \\r\\n  Medication   AFTER breakfast\\r\\n  \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n  \\r\\n  Snack\\r\\n  \\r\\n  \\r\\n     \\r\\n  \\r\\n  Healthy snack   at school\\r\\n●        Yogurt (or yogurt drink),   granola bar, nuts, crackers, cheese, vegetables with dip, etc. \\r\\n  \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n  \\r\\n  Lunch\\r\\n  \\r\\n  \\r\\n     \\r\\n  \\r\\n  Provide   lunchtime foods that can be eaten easily and quickly -- it might be simply   more healthy “finger” foods.  \\r\\n●        Serving a sandwich? Cut into   4 pieces to make it seem smaller and less effort to eat. \\r\\n\\r\\nAsk the school   to help monitor and encourage lunch to be eaten BEFORE going out for recess. \\r\\n  \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n  \\r\\n  After school snack \\r\\n  \\r\\n  \\r\\n     \\r\\n  \\r\\n  Healthy snack   after school\\r\\n●        Have healthy snacks and foods   readily available, to avoid them from seeking out junk food. \\r\\n  \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n  \\r\\n  Dinnertime \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n  \\r\\n     \\r\\n  \\r\\n  Family dinner\\r\\n●        Note that some kids might not   have much appetite for dinner as there is still long acting medication in   their system. \\r\\n  \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n  \\r\\n  After dinner snack\\r\\n  \\r\\n  \\r\\n        \\r\\n  \\r\\n  Does your child get hungry after the   medication wears off later in the evening?\\r\\n●        Many parents report their   child may have a “second supper” after the medication wears off. ●        Accept that you may need to   reheat dinner for them at this time; or simply eat like many Europeans do,   with a later 7-8 PM dinner. \\r\\n     \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nManagement Strategies : Medication \\r\\nNon-medication Strategies \\r\\n●      Try to wait it out while trying various strategies. Many patients report their appetite improves after they have been on their stimulant medication for at least a couple of months\\r\\n(Silver, 2019)\\r\\nMedication strategies\\r\\n❏    Consider a drug holiday which is a period of time taking a break from stimulant medication. Examples include;❏    Not taking medications on weekends.❏    Not taking medications during holiday periods, such as summer holidays or winter break. \\r\\nWhen and Where to Find Help? \\r\\nAre there still troubles with low appetite and troubles gaining weight appropriately? \\r\\n●      Consider seeing a registered dietician, who can help with dietary strategies. ●      See your healthcare provider and ask about medication options, e.g. switching to a different stimulant; trying a non-stimulant; adding a medication to increase appetite, etc. ●      Explore non-medication strategies for ADHD. ○      See an occupational therapist that may be able to help with strategies, including treatments such as Interactive Metronome (IM).○      Drumming lessons may be helpful for developing focused attention (Cahart, 2022; Frantz, 2020, Gilden 2009).  \\r\\nReferences \\r\\nCahart MS et al.: The effect of learning to drum on behavior and brain function in autistic adolescents.

       "'\\r\\n\\tWhat is an Operational Stress Injury (OSI)?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAn OSI is term used to describe any persistent psychological injury resulting from operational or work-related duties in the military or police service.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tWhat Causes OSI\\'s?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMany situations may cause an OSI, which include:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tBeing involved in combat\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tWitnessing atrocities\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tComing close to death\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tBeing assaulted\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tSeeing someone killed or killing someone\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tBeing held hostage\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tNatural disasters\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tHandling injured bodies and human remains\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tCanadian Forces and law enforcement personnel are regularly exposed to extreme situations beyond the experience of most people. Similarly to how physical strain may affect the body, an extreme or lasting psychological stress may cause injuries to the brain and mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tCommon Types of OSI’s:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tSubstance Use Disorders such as problems with alcohol and marijuana\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tAnxiety Disorders, such as panic attacks and phobia\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tMood Disorders, such as problems with depression and anger\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tHow Common are OSI’s?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs many as 10-20% of those involved in operational duties may develop OSI.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tSymptoms of OSI’s:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThere are many possible signs of an OSI, such as:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tRe-experiencing and flashbacks – unwanted vivid recollections of the event\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tDisturbed sleep with nightmares\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tIrritability or anger\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tDecreased concentration\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tExaggerated startle response and hypervigilance\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tAvoidance of people, places that remind one of the traumatic event\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tPanic attacks and anxiety\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tLoss of interest in activities\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tHow Are OSI’s Treated?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThere are many types of effective treatments for OSI\\'s that are offered by professionals:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tCognitive behaviour therapy (CBT): Helps individuals cope with depression and anxiety by focusing on changing their thoughts and behaviours. In CBT, individuals learn to replace negative or worry thoughts with more rational and helpful alternatives..\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tProlonged Exposure (PE): PE is a form of CBT that involves reviewing the traumatic event by recounting it in detail and working with the reminders (triggers) of the trauma rather than avoiding them. This treatment method is very effective for OSI’s and involves individual work with a clinician and homework each week.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tCognitive Processing Therapy (CPT): CPT involves achieving a better understanding of the traumatic event, processing traumatic experience and acquiring the skills needed for better coping. This treatment method is also CBT-based and may be done individually or within a group.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tGroup therapy:&nbsp; Group therapy involves meeting with a group of people who have also been through trauma and have an OSI, with guidance from a group leader (such as a psychologist or social worker). Group therapy is powerful because you are meeting with others who understand what you\\'ve been through. Sharing with the group also can help you build self-confidence and trust. Unlike some therapies which focus on the past, group work focuses on the present.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tFamily therapy: Family therapy is a type of counseling that involves your whole family which is important because OSI\\'s can affect the family, and family support is needed to help you cope with an OSI. A therapist helps you and your family to communicate, maintain good relationships, and cope with difficult emotions. In family therapy, each person can express his or her fears and concerns. By doing this, your family will be better prepared to help you.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tMedications: Various medications, such as antidepressants, may be helpful to reduce the symptoms of OSI, such as depression, anxiety and insomnia, and these may be prescribed by a family physician or psychiatrist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tHow Can I Help Myself If I Have an OSI?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tKnow your limits and triggers.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tEducate yourself\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tConfide in someone you trust\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tAccess resources in your community, your place of work\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tGetting Help for an OSI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tSpeak with your medical doctor.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tDon\\'t keep everything to yourself; chances are, your family and friends have already noticed something is different, and are already concerned about you.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tSet up a support network for yourself, e.g. Tell a trusted friend or family member (e.g. spouse) about your difficulties, so they can understand you and support you. For example, you might say: \"Can we talk? I want to tell you about something that\\'s been going on with me. Ever since _____, I\\'ve been having troubles with _____. I need your support to help me get through this. This is what I need from you...\"\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tIf you are still serving, you can\\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSpeak with Psychosocial Services at your base\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSpeak with a Padre\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSeek peer support through Operational Stress Injury Social Support (OSISS), 1-800-883-6094, http://www.osiss.ca\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf you are a veteran, you can contact Veteran\\'s Affairs Canada (VAC) at 1-866-522-2122, http://www.veterans.gc.ca\\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tYou are not alone. The sooner you seek assistance, the better. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\t&nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tPeople commonly delay talking about their symptoms out of fear that it may affect their career and relationships. But it is worse for your work and relationship when OSI symptoms persist and worsen!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tHow to Support a Friend or Family Member With an OSI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tSeek peer support for family members through Operational Stress Injury Social Support (OSISS), 1-800-883-6094, http://www.osiss.ca\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tListen. You might say: “You don\\'t seem yourself these days... I notice that...&nbsp; What\\'s up? How are you doing these days?\"\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tValidate. Regardless of how your friend is feeling, s/he is responding this way to the trauma because this is one of the standard ways that a person may respond. You might simply say, \"Yeah, that sounds pretty.... (agreeing with how your friend is feeling)\"\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tDon\\'t judge or minimize what your friend/family member is going through. Try to avoid statements like \"It could have been worse...\" Most of the time, this is not helpful; there is ALWAYS someone who has had it worse. Saying that things could have been worse generally makes the person with an OSI feel even more guilty and ashamed about their \\'trivial\\' difficulties, which thus prevents them from opening up and getting help.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tEncourage your friend or family member to get help, and let them know that\\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThere are effective treatments that they can access, and \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe sooner someone with an OSI initiates treatment, the better for that person and their family.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYou might say: \"You don\\'t have to feel this way. It can get better. There are professionals that can help with this. If you want, we can make the call together, and how about I\\'ll drive you to the appointment. And then we can go for a coffee after?\"\\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tSupporting another person can be exhausting, so don\\'t neglect your own health. It’s great to support your loved one, but if you are neglecting your own physical health, and if it is affecting your own work and relationships, then you probably need to set limits.&nbsp; Example: \"I\\'m here to support you. This is what I can do.... This is what I can\\'t do...&nbsp; Right now, you need more than I can provide. We have to get you to see someone.\"\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tSeek support from family and/or friends. Whether you prefer to cope by being physical, by talking, or some other way, remember that you need your own support network too.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tTry to set reasonable expectations for both yourself and your family member(s). Until your friend or loved one has healed from the OSI, this usually means that you will have to reduce expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tKnow that you are also not alone and that supports may be available to you also.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tKey Facts About OSI\\'s\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tAn OSI is a normal response to an abnormal event\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tAn OSI can happen to anyone; it is not a sign of weakness\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tYou are not alone\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tEffective, researched treatments are available to you\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t\\tThe sooner a comprehensive assessment and treatment are initiated, the better the future\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAbout This Document\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tWritten by Shelley Hale, RSSW, RSW; Jakov Shlik, MD, FRCPC, Royal Ottawa Operational Stress Injury Clinic; LCdr Rose Collins, RN, BScN, MScN, CPMHN(C), Canadian Forces, Mental Health Directorate; and reviewed by members of the eMentalHealth.ca Editorial Team.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tDisclaimer\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tInformation in this pamphlet is offered ‘as is\\' and is meant only to provide general information that supplements, but does not replace the information from your health provider.

Get setSet a goal that makes sense to you and that you can stick to. Your goal could involve reducing the amount you drink per occasion, or drinking no alcohol in higher-risk situations (e.g., before driving or other activities when alertness is required). It may involve avoiding intoxication or reducing the total amount you drink through the run of a typical week. Or, it may be a combination of these. You may even choose to quit drinking altogether.Whatever your goal, write it down, post it where you will see it regularly and share your plan with someone you trust.3. Get goingTake action to reach your goals. That is, help yourself succeed by making changes to your drinking lifestyle and social routine. For example, you couldcut back on social activities that involve drinking,try different social activities that don’t involve drinking,build in one or two non-drinking days during the week,find alternative ways to deal with anger, boredom or feeling upset, andtake note of people, places and times that lead to your drinking even when you don’t particularly want to use alcohol.4. Keep goingDon't give up on your goals, because change is never easy!Celebrate (sensibly, of course!) any positive changes you’ve made, even tiny ones.Consider outside help.

Anger problems have also been associated with higher levels of perceived pain and problems associated with heart disease.', '', 'People who experience more frequent and more intense anger often try to avoid expressing their anger or express their anger in unhelpful ways (e.g., yelling, making hurtful comments, etc.). When we experience anger problems, we tend to cope less well with stress, have lower self-esteem, are more likely to misuse drugs or alcohol, and judge other people unfairly. For example, we may blame others for bad events without knowing all the facts or assume other people have wronged us on purpose.

      "{'Three Stories': ['Mohamed is a 4-yo who parents always sensed was different. He seemed more interested in objects than people. They tried putting him into a home daycare, but he was aggressive with the other kids and was thus unable to return. The daycare he attends reports that he is sometimes aggressive toward other children, and his parents are concerned because he only uses 3-4 words to communicate.', 'Thomas is a 10-yo boy who has always been into science and everything mechanical. He’ll take apart anything mechanical and is like an encyclopaedia when it comes to all things technical. On the other hand, he has trouble connecting with other kids his age and is bullied by others.', 'Jasmin is a 14-yo female who has always been introverted. She has always had an active imagination. She’d play for hours with her dolls and would create an elaborate fantasy world for each one of them. Now that she is older, she has more trouble with the expectations at school and home. Whenever parents try to ask her to stop doing her preferred activities, she has terrible meltdowns.'], 'What is Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)?': [\"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurological condition that affects a person's ability to communicate, understand, play and relate to others.Classic symptoms include:\", 'Problems with social communication and interaction:Those with lower functioning ASD may have trouble with language, making it hard to communicate with others.Those with higher functioning ASD may have typically developing language but may have:Challenges with social communication. For example, they might have difficulty making eye contact, understanding gestures, body language and social cues.Challenges seeing other’s perspectives. They may see things from their perspective and act in inappropriate ways without realizing how their behaviours affect others or make others feel.Restricted or repetitive behaviours, interests or activities, which may include::Unusual play with toys and objects. A child on the autism spectrum may play with toys but often will play with them differently than other children do. For example, a child playing with cars may line them up over and over again or be obsessed with parts of a toy or repeatedly take apart and put a toy back together.Rigid routines and preoccupation with routines or rituals.People with ASD may have an extreme need for consistency and routines and may become distressed if there are changes in routines or if others make external demands, e.g. asking the child to come for dinner, get ready for school, etc.Difficulty following others’ instructions, demands or expectations:Their need for autonomy (e.g. preferred activities and routines) is so strong, that they may become distressed when others infringe on their autonomy (e.g. when others make a demand or request that takes them away from their preferred activity). Their actual fight/flight system can be triggered, with anger (“fight”), anxiety (“flight”), and tantrums / meltdowns.Sensory processing problems such as:Hypersensitivity to sensory input, becoming distressed with sound, being touched or movement.Under sensitivity to sensory input, seek out sensory input such as making more sound, touching everything, moving all the time. E.g. screaming, looking for squeezes on their head, heads or legs; spinning.Because sensory processing problems make it hard to self-regulate, they have trouble being calm enough to learn and function.', 'Problems with social communication and interaction:Those with lower functioning ASD may have trouble with language, making it hard to communicate with others.Those with higher functioning ASD may have typically developing language but may have:Challenges with social communication.

This method is known as behavioural activation and has been shown in studies to be an effective treatment for depression.The following strategies have antidepressant properties and can improve both physical and mental health:Practice self-acceptance and self-compassion.One of the problems of depression is that many of us tend to have a self-critical voice that makes us feel guilty or ashamed for being depressed. Perhaps it\\'s because we think that being self-critical will be helpful, but unfortunately, it usually doesn\\'t help and makes us feel worse. There is an alternative... Accept that you are imperfect and flawed because, after all, you are only human. Humans get depressed, and you are human.

      "{'About the Disorder': ['Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is an umbrella term that describes a wide range of effects that can occur in a child whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause significant brain damage. The effects of FASD typically include physical, mental, and learning disabilities as well as behavioral deficits and problems with socialization.', '', 'FASD includes the following categories:', 'Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)—This is indicated by a pattern of neurological, behavioral, and cognitive deficits along with specific facial features.Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND)— This term is used when only central nervous system abnormalities are present as a result of the fetal alcohol exposure. ARND is characterized by problems with memory and motor skills.Alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD)—This is indicated by defects in the growth of skeletal and major organ systems.Fetal alcohol effects (FAE)—This term is sometimes used to describe children who had prenatal exposure to alcohol but do not have all the symptoms (particularly the facial features) associated with FAS.', 'Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)—This is indicated by a pattern of neurological, behavioral, and cognitive deficits along with specific facial features.', 'Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND)— This term is used when only central nervous system abnormalities are present as a result of the fetal alcohol exposure. ARND is characterized by problems with memory and motor skills.', 'Alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD)—This is indicated by defects in the growth of skeletal and major organ systems.', 'Fetal alcohol effects (FAE)—This term is sometimes used to describe children who had prenatal exposure to alcohol but do not have all the symptoms (particularly the facial features) associated with FAS.', 'Some children will have no physical symptoms of FAS. If it is certain that a child was exposed to alcohol before birth but there are no physical symptoms and the child’s early childhood screening appears to be within normal development, a followup screening may be necessary when the child is older if behavioral or learning deficits become apparent.'], 'What You May See': ['An infant with FASD may be very irritable, fussy, and/or cry a lot for no apparent reason. As a child with FASD grows, parents and caregivers may begin to notice that the child’s\\xa0development of gross motor skills is delayed—for example the child may walk or run with an awkward gait, have difficulty tossing and catching a ball, and/or struggle to be\\xa0able to hop on one foot. The child may also exhibit cognitive deficits—for example the child may have trouble problem solving, difficulty planning future actions, and problems\\xa0taking in, storing, and recalling information. Because of damage to the brain, a child with FASD is sometimes overly sensitive to sensory input—for example they may be upset by bright lights, loud noises, and tags on their clothes.', '', 'As the child’s development continues, parents and caregivers may notice that the child has verbal skills that exceed their level of understanding, which will sometimes lead a child to say they understand something when they don’t. They are also likely to have difficulty following multiple directions. These challenges are frustrating and can lead the child to emotional outbursts. Along with auditory processing problems, parents may also see a child develop oppositional behaviors and a pattern of not completing tasks or chores they are asked to do.', '', 'As a child with FASD has more social interactions, parents and caregivers may notice that the disorder can cause the child to misinterpret others’ words, actions, or body\\xa0movements, which can make it harder for the child to determine how to respond to different situations. It is also typical for children with FASD to miss social cues and be\\xa0unable to entertain themselves. This too can lead to social problems and acting out.'], 'Symptoms': ['May cry a lot and be irritable as an infantMay have tremorsSensitive to sights, sounds, and touchEasily over-stimulated, then hard to sootheProblems with bondingInappropriate social interactions (for example willingness to leave with a stranger or hugging strangers—strangers can be either child or adult)Unable to comprehend danger and does not respond well to verbal warningsProne to temper tantrums and noncomplianceDifficulty handling changes in routineMotor skills lag behind children of the same ageMay be disinterested in foodMay have disrupted sleepDistractible, unable to concentrate, poor memoryInconsistent behaviors, skill levels from day to dayMay be able to state a rule but not follow itNo recognizable play themes or organizationHas difficulty with requests or instructions that have more than two steps', 'May cry a lot and be irritable as an infant', 'May have tremors', 'Sensitive to sights, sounds, and touch', 'Easily over-stimulated, then hard to soothe', 'Problems with bonding', 'Inappropriate social interactions (for example willingness to leave with a stranger or hugging strangers—strangers can be either child or adult)', 'Unable to comprehend danger and does not respond well to verbal warnings', 'Prone to temper tantrums and noncompliance', 'Difficulty handling changes in routine', 'Motor skills lag behind children of the same age', 'May be disinterested in food', 'May have disrupted sleep', 'Distractible, unable to concentrate, poor memory', 'Inconsistent behaviors, skill levels from day to day', 'May be able to state a rule but not follow it', 'No recognizable play themes or organization', 'Has difficulty with requests or instructions that have more than two steps'], 'Strategies': ['Because damage to the developing brain varies, each child’s development will be different; however, the following strategies work well with many children who have FASD:', 'Speak simply and concretely.

      "{'Introduction': ['Interestingly, most (if not all) human societies have societal practices such as drumming, singing or dancing to a beat.', 'In indigenous society, drums are sacred, representing the heartbeat of people, animals and Mother Earth herself.', 'Many of us may still be able to remember how we sang, dance or clapped in preschool or kindergarten.', 'Modern understanding of neuroscience is now confirming what many people intuitively know. That there are brain benefits from many of these traditional activities.', 'Singing, dancing and clapping in synchrony with others is not simply fun. Such rhythmic movement activities in preschool can support the neurologic basis of self-regulation.', 'Unfortunately, as kids grow older, many stop doing these types of brain-building activities.'], 'What Does the Brain Science Show?': ['Growing research shows that drumming interventions may have therapeutic benefits for various brain conditions such as Alzheimer’s (Keough, 2017), PTSD (Bensimon, 2005;\\xa0Lithke, 2019), and autism (Willemin, 2018; Cahart, 2022).', '', 'Studies show that people who drum have improved impulse control (Slater, 2017).', 'For students with ADHD, drumming has been proposed as a type of music intervention in the classroom (Frantz, 2020). Studies have shown that people with ADHD do have more difficulties sustaining a rhythm with others because they have a rhythm cut-off that is faster than those without ADHD (Gilden, 2009). Treatments such as interactive metronome (IM) are theorized to help ADHD by improving this sense of timing (Shaffer, 2001).', 'For teenagers with autism, a recent study shows that drumming may help improve socialization skills, inhibition control and focus (Cahart, 2022). Half of 36 people with ASD received a drumming intervention of 8 weeks of drumming lessons, twice per week, whereas the control group did not. In the drumming group, there were improvements in ADHD symptoms, social skills and self-regulation. Brain changes were confirmed on fMRI scan, showing improved connectivity in areas responsible for inhibitory control, action outcomes monitoring and self-regulation.', 'Drumming has the potential to benefit anyone wanting to improve their attention skills, impulse control and self-regulation.'], 'How Does Drumming Help the Brain?': ['Drumming requires beat synchronization, the ability to tap or move to a beat. This requires various skills such as', 'Attention skills (i.e. listening to the beat)Motor skills and hand-eye coordination  (i.e. moving to the beat).Sense of timing;Ability to monitor and correct mistakes.', 'Attention skills (i.e. listening to the beat)', 'Motor skills and hand-eye coordination  (i.e. moving to the beat).', 'Sense of timing;', 'Ability to monitor and correct mistakes.', 'Drumming with another person requires listening to another and responding to another person (i.e. requiring a sense of empathy).', 'All of the above foundational lower-level skills are important for higher-level skills such as self-regulation, social skills and well-being (Cahart, 2022).'], 'Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)': ['Q. My loved one doesn’t have the coordination to hold drum sticks.', 'A. The drumming instruction will adapt the drumming to your child’s skill level. For example, one could start with drums played by the hands, which is less complicated than holding drum sticks.', 'Q. I like quiet, and I’m afraid it would get too loud in our home with drums.', 'A. If you decide to get drums for home, there are many quiet options, such as getting a  simple drum pad (a rubber pad) or electronic drums (where you wear headphones). And you can encourage drumming outside, which will provide nature benefit as well.', 'Q. My loved one is sensitive to noise.', 'A. The drumming instructor can find a quieter type of drum to start with. And because your child will have a sense of control by being the one making the sounds, they will be better able to tolerate the sound.'], 'Where to Find Drumming?': ['Do a search for\\xa0“therapeutic drumming” in your area, and/or', 'Look for drumming instructors in your area.', \"To duplicate what was done in Cahart's clinical trials, aim for\\xa0two drumming lessons per week, at least 45-min. In length.\", \"To duplicate what was done in Cahart's clinical trials, aim for\\xa0two drumming lessons per week, at least 45-min. In length.\"], 'Therapy Based on Similar Principles': ['It is interesting to note that there are other types of therapeutic interventions and treatments offered by professionals that appear to harness similar principles of timing and beat synchrony.', 'Interactive Metronome (IM)', 'Interactive metronome is a type of therapy where with the help of computer equipment, a person (with the help of a therapist) learns to improve their beat synchrony, their ability to clap to a beat. Improving this foundational skill thus helps later skills such as attention, focus, impulse control, and motor/sensory skills.'], 'Practices Incorporating Similar Principles': ['Other activities which practice sequenced movements include those found in dancing, such as highland dancing and tap dancing.

The two main types of treatments that can help OCD are:', '', '1. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT): a type of therapy that helps a person with OCD learn new ways to think (\"cognitive\") and ways to do things (\"behavioural\") to deal with the OCD. CBT is usually provided by a psychologist or psychiatrist. There are many books on OCD as well, which makes it easier and easier for people with OCD and their families to learn about these strategies and use them on their own (e.g., \"Talking Back to OCD\" by John March).', '1.

Cognitive StrategiesOCD makes a person have OCD thoughts, and cognitive (thought) strategies are about replacing OCD thoughts with more helpful thoughts.For example, a person with cleanliness obsessions touches something at work and gets the automatic thought (cognition), \"Now I\\'m all dirty and I\\'m going to get sick! I have to wash my hands!\"Cognitive techniques help the person develop more helpful coping thoughts such as, e.g. \"I\\'m not going to let the OCD push me around! So what if I\\'ve just touched ___? I\\'m not going to get sick.\"2. Behavioural techniquesa) OCD HierarchyA hierarchy is a way of deciding which OCD behaviours to work on first. It involves ranking one\\'s compulsions (or obsessions) from those that are easy to resist, to those that are \\'medium\\' difficulty to resist, to those that are extremely hard to resist doing.b) Exposure with Response PreventionExposureis exposing yourself to the feared situation that triggers the OCD. For example, if your hand washing rituals are triggered by touching \"contaminated\" objects, then you would gradually touch \"contaminated\" objects, in a gradually increasing way.Response preventionis preventing the response (or ritual) that the OCD tries to boss you into doing.For example, a person with hand washing compulsions would feel an urge to wash his/her hands after touching \"contaminated\" objects.

It can happen just once in a while. And after an abuse happens, the other person may go out of his/her way in being nice and promising that it won't happen it again... But unfortunately, the abuse usually does happen again...\"], 'Abuse Can Start at Any Time': [\"The abuse also doesn't have to start off at the beginning of the relationship.

The person has trouble getting to sleep on time, ends up going to bed too late, and then ends up exhausted when they have to wake up the following day.

However, they have significant improvements in their sleep when they go to bed later and wake up later.'], 'Normal Sleep Physiology': ['Sleep timing is controlled by the master circadian clock, located in a part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. This clock determines what time we should go to sleep and what time we wake up.  Our clock requires constant “resetting” by external time cues (aka “zeitgebers”), and the most important ones that set our clock include exposure to sunlight during the morning and daytime, as well as exposure to darkness in the evenings. Other time cues that influence this biological clock include physical activity, mealtimes, and work /social schedules.'], 'What Causes Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase?': ['In normal adolescence, there is a shift towards a delayed sleep phase in puberty, where adolescents will need to go to bed later and wake up later. This sleep phase then advances with each decade. In people with DSWPD, this shift is more extreme. If these persons try to work/live in a typical societal schedule (e.g. try to sleep from 11 PM to 7 AM), they can experience significant problems due to the mismatch between their social / work schedule and their internal clock (circadian phase).', '', 'There seems to be a link between those with DSWPD and conditions such as ADHD and bipolar disorder.'], 'Could I Have Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase?': ['Two ways to really confirm\\xa0if you might have delayed sleep-wake phase are:', '', '1) Consider doing the Morning-Eveningness Questionnaire', 'https://chronotype-self-test.info/index.php?sid=61524&newtest=Y', '', 'The results of this questionnaire will help inform whether you are a morning type (\"lark\"), intermediate type, or evening type (\"night owl\").', '', 'Did you identify as an evening type?
