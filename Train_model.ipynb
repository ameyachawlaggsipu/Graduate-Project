It turns out that he has been upset at his father, but afraid to tell his father. He has also had some troubles with some classmates at school that have been mean to him. Now that he is able to express some of his stresses more easily, his parents are more easily able to support him. They learn together about what triggers his voices, and he learns to express when he is starting to get upset or stressed. Through openly talking to parents about his problems, and by seeing that parents accept him despite his problems, he learns to accept himself as well, i.e. self-compassion.\\n\\ndave\\u2019s story, part 2:\\n Dave is doing much better now  -- the angry voices haven\\u2019t been around for a long time, and when there is a voice, it is a gentle, kind forgiving voice that helps him regulate his feelings -- for example, if he makes a mistake, the voice will say, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay, everyone makes mistakes.\\u201d\\n\\nfor resources:\\n Hearing Voices Network \\u2013 self-help group for people hearing voices.

(Malla 2006). Psychosis is linked to chemical imbalances of neurotransmitters in the brain, especially dopamine. Various medications which address these chemical imbalances can be very effective in controlling the symptoms of psychosis. Such medications are known as \\u2018anti-psychotics' or \\u2018neuroleptics.'\\n\\nhow is psychosis treated?:\\n After the symptoms of psychosis are reduced enough by medications, then the person will be better able to benefit from other interventions such as counselling / therapy.\\n\\nprognosis:\\n If a person has an episode of psychosis, and is treated with antipsychotic medication, then\\u00a0it is normally recommended that they remain on antipsychotic medication for at least one year.\\n\\nprognosis:\\n After one year, 70% of patients who remain in active treatment will be in remission (Malla et al 2002).\\n\\nprognosis:\\n If a patient has had good symptom control in the first year of treatment and wishes to come off medication, then this can be arranged provided it is under close medical supervision.\\n\\nprognosis:\\n Some people will be symptom free, even after medication is withdrawn.A majority of patients however, are at risk of having\\u00a0recurrent episodes of psychosis, or may even have continuing symptoms of psychosis.\\n\\nprognosis:\\n If symptoms of psychosis tend to be continuous, particularly for a period of longer than six months, then diagnosis of schizophrenia is made.\\n\\nprognosis:\\n The vast majority of such patients, however, i.e. greater than 65%, will get complete, or near-complete resolution of their symptoms with ongoing treatment.\\n\\nhelping someone with psychosis in general:\\n Ensure physical health.Help the person to eat properly (three nutritious meals a day with healthy snacks), get enough sleep, and get regular physical exercise (anything active is good, including dancing to favourite music or playing \\\"air-guitar\\\".)Avoid recreational drugs.Marijuana, hallucinogens (e.g. mushrooms), and stimulants can all worsen or trigger\\u00a0psychosis, and should be avoided as much as possible.\\n\\nhelping someone with psychosis in general:\\n Help your loved one\\u00a0get treatment.Help your loved one get to doctor's appointments. If medications have been prescribed, then support the person in taking their medications.\\n\\nhelping someone with psychosis in general:\\n Emotional support: caregivers might say something like \\\"I want you to know that I'm here for you. How can I help you?\\\" \\\"Tell me what I can do to support you.\\\"\\n\\nhelping someone with psychosis in general:\\n Don't invalidate the other person.Don't laugh or tell the other person that s/he is stupid or crazy, as this will make the other person less interested in confiding with you. Don't say \\\"its just in your head.\\\"\\n\\nhelping someone with psychosis in general:\\n Get support from people that your relative trusts.If there is a particular person that your relative trusts (and if you trust that person as well!), enlist that person's help.\\n\\nhelping someone with psychosis in general:\\n Reduce stress.Psychosis is made worse if the person is under a lot of stress. Help the person identify what stresses they are under, and come up with a plan to deal with each one of them.\\n\\nhelping someone with psychosis in general:\\n Figure out what helps.Assist the person to keep track of what helps, and what doesn't help their symptoms. Keeping a diary can help with this.\\n\\nhelping someone with psychosis in general:\\n Keep things calm and avoid over stimulation.Psychosis makes people sensitive to being overloaded. If there is too much going on (e.g. if too many people are around), help the person with psychosis to take a break by suggesting a quiet walk or having nap...\\n\\nhelping someone with psychosis in general:\\n Care for the caregiver.If you are looking after someone with psychosis, make sure that you have someone to talk to who understands your experience, and that you take a break too! If you get burnt out, then who will look after your loved one?\\n\\nhelping someone who has delusions:\\n Validate the other person, but without reinforcing any delusions.Caregivers might say something like \\\"You're telling me that you're worried about the CIA spying and following you. How's that feel?\\\" Then, after the other person talks about how s/he is feeling, it is important to validate that feeling. \\\"I can completely see how you might feel scared. I'd feel scared too, if I felt that I was being followed.\\\" In this way, you can empathize with how the person is feeling, without necessarily needing to say that you agree with the delusion.\\n\\nhelping someone who has delusions:\\n Help the other person challenge unhelpful thoughts.In a gentle way, caregivers could try to show the other person the evidence for and against the delusion, in an attempt to help the person see that there is no evidence for the delusion. Caregivers might say, \\\"I hear what you're saying. Tell me - what have you noticed that leads you to think that you're being followed?\\\" \\\"Why would they follow you?\\\" \\\"Are there any other possibilities?\\\"\\u00a0 Ask for permission before telling the other person that their thoughts might not be correct. \\\"I care about you - would you be okay if I gave you my thoughts?\\\"\\u00a0 \\\"Based on what you've told me, you have done nothing wrong, so there is no reason for the police to be following you.\\\"\\n\\nhelping someone who has delusions:\\n Help the other person replace unhelpful with more helpful thoughts.\\\"You told me you wanted to not feel so scared all the time. Instead of thinking, \\u2018everyone is out to get me', are there other, more helpful thoughts that would make you feel safer?\\\"\\n\\ncoping strategies for hallucinations:\\n Avoid things that worsen hallucinations.Avoid chemicals such as stimulants (like caffeine), alcohol and street drugs (especially marijuana, hallucinogens and stimulants).\\n\\ncoping strategies for hallucinations:\\n Keep busy.Hallucinations often happen when people are bored. Keep busy by doing things that require attention such as\\n\\ncoping strategies for hallucinations:\\n Talking to yourself. \\u00a0Many people say that talking aloud helps. Try humming or singing quietly to yourself. Repeat a calming phrase, such as \\\"I am safe, I am okay.\\\" Try reading aloud. You can get something called a \\\"whisper-phone\\\" if your talking disturbs others -- a whisper phone is a plumbing joint, where you speak into it and you\\u00a0 can hear the sound, but it doesn't disturb others.\\n\\ncoping strategies for hallucinations:\\n Say to yourself \\\"I am a good person\\\" or something along those lines.Ask people to write downgoodthings about you on a piece of paper so you can read it when the negative voices start.Tape record what people like about you and also what you feel are positive qualities that you have. Listen to it.\\n\\ncoping strategies for hallucinations:\\n Ask people to write downgoodthings about you on a piece of paper so you can read it when the negative voices start.\\n\\ncoping strategies for hallucinations:\\n Tape record what people like about you and also what you feel are positive qualities that you have.

Even if issues of confidentiality may prevent a service provider from giving you information, it is still very useful for you to provide them with information.\\n\\nyour role in your loved one's recovery:\\n Importance of Hope -Recovery is a process that is different for each person.\\u00a0 Your relative may become impatient or discouraged.\\u00a0 Be supportive and positive.\\u00a0 Understand that small steps forward may be huge accomplishments for the person with psychosis..\\n\\nmy story, part 1:\\n It all started in college.

I learned that it\\u2019s quite common for people with psychosis to have other mental illnesses. And with my family history, it was no real surprise. They gave me medication at first to control the paranoia and delusions I was having. I wasn\\u2019t thrilled about this at first, but it was actually quite helpful.\\n\\nmy story, part 2:\\n The year following my first episode was really hard. The challenging part was changing the way I was living my life. My counsellor helped me to gain more control over my life by reducing the stresses. No more staying up until the wee hours of the morning. No more drinking and partying. Eating a regular, healthy diet and exercising everyday gave me a good routine and helped me structure my life.\\n\\nmy story, part 2:\\n Although I had to take some time off from school, I was able to return with a reduced course load. This was a big shift for me at first. But I\\u2019m really happy with my new lifestyle. This whole experience made me realize that I need to take care of myself. I fill my time with plenty of calm and low key hobbies, like scrapbooking and photography. I make sure I don\\u2019t become too stimulated. I\\u2019ve also made some new friends along the way. And with the help of my family and friends, I\\u2019m a lot more thankful for the simple things in life.\\n\\nwant to learn more?:\\n The Early Psychosis Intervention (EPI) website has a very helpful \\u201cDealing with Psychosis Toolkit (DWP)\\u201d, with detailed information on practical strategies for psychosis.\\n\\nintroduction:\\n Schizophrenia is a serious brain disorder that causes changes in a person's thoughts, perceptions, emotions and behaviours. It can make someone hear or see things that others cannot see. It can make someone feel unsafe, afraid, and lead to avoiding other people, and loss of function. Without proper treatment, it can cause serious problems with school, work and relationships. Fortunately, help is available for those with schizophrenia. In addition, there are many things that family and friends can do to support their loved ones with schizophrenia.\\n\\ndo i have schizophrenia?:\\n The following is a list of some symptoms of schizophrenia. If you (or a loved one) have these symptoms, speak with a doctor.\\n\\ndo i have schizophrenia?:\\n Hear voices that others can't hear?See things that others can't see?Have extreme difficulties thinking clearly? Find that your thoughts appear jumbled?\\n\\nwhat are the symptoms of schizophrenia?:\\n Hallucinations:Hearing voices is the most common type of hallucination in schizophrenia. Some people hear one voice, others hear many. These voices sound like a voice inside the person's head. The voice may make comments about the person, or be critical and say mean things. Or the voice may order the person around and tell them to do things. Other types of hallucinations include seeing people or objects that are not there.\\n\\nwhat are the symptoms of schizophrenia?:\\n Delusions of reference: You feel that others are talking about you. For example, when you turn on the television, or read the newspaper, you feel that its about you.Delusions of persecution: You feel that others are out to harm you. Wherever you go, you may feel that people are spying on you, following you, and planning to harm you in some way.\\n\\nwhat are the symptoms of schizophrenia?:\\n Delusions of reference: You feel that others are talking about you.

Wherever you go, you may feel that people are spying on you, following you, and planning to harm you in some way.\\n\\nwhat are the symptoms of schizophrenia?:\\n 2. Passive (or \\\"Negative symptoms\\\") symptomsare a loss of skills or abilities, such as having a loss or decrease in the ability to initiate plans, speak, express emotion, or find pleasure in everyday life. These symptoms are harder to recognize as part of the disorder and can be mistaken for laziness or depression. You may notice that its hard to think clearly.\\n\\nwhat causes schizophrenia?:\\n There is no one single cause for schizophrenia, however there are different factors which can increase a person's risk of getting schizophrenia:\\n\\nwhat causes schizophrenia?:\\n Family history: Being related to other family members with schizophrenia can increase a person's risk of getting schizophrenia.Drug use: Using certain types of drugs, such as marijuana, or alcohol can increase a risk of psychosis. In people at high risk (e.g. such as those with family members with schizophrenia or psychosis), it is safest to avoid stimulants (such as cocaine, amphetamines), marijuana or PCP (\\\"angel dust\\\").Stress: Having significant stress from school, work, home or relationships can increase one's risk.\\n\\nwhat causes schizophrenia?:\\n Family history: Being related to other family members with schizophrenia can increase a person's risk of getting schizophrenia.\\n\\nwhat causes schizophrenia?:\\n Drug use: Using certain types of drugs, such as marijuana, or alcohol can increase a risk of psychosis. In people at high risk (e.g. such as those with family members with schizophrenia or psychosis), it is safest to avoid stimulants (such as cocaine, amphetamines), marijuana or PCP (\\\"angel dust\\\").\\n\\nhow is schizophrenia treated?:\\n Although there is no cure for schizophrenia, there are many treatments that can help significantly such as:\\n\\ntreatment: medications:\\n Medications that treat psychosis (antipsychotic medications) are effective in reducing symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions.\\n\\ntreatment: medications:\\n The original antipsychotic medications include chlorpromazine (Thorazine\\u00ae), haloperidol (Haldol\\u00ae), perphenazine (Etrafon\\u00ae, Trilafon\\u00ae), and fluphenzine (Prolixin\\u00ae). The older medications can cause movement side effects, such as rigidity, persistent muscle spasms, tremors, and restlessness.\\n\\ntreatment: medications:\\n In the 1990s, new drugs, called atypical antipsychotics, were developed that rarely produced these side effects. Examples include: risperidone (Risperdal\\u00ae), olanzapine (Zyprexa\\u00ae), quietiapine (Seroquel\\u00ae), sertindole (Serdolect\\u00ae), and ziprasidone (Geodon\\u00ae).\\n\\ntreatment: medications:\\n Everyone responds differently to antipsychotic medication. Sometimes several different drugs must be tried before the right one is found.\\n\\ntreatment: medications:\\n When on a new medication, agitation and hallucinations usually improve within days and delusions usually improve within a few weeks. Many people see substantial improvement in both types of symptoms by the sixth week of treatment. No one can tell beforehand exactly how a medication will affect a particular individual, and sometimes several medications must be tried before the right one is found.\\n\\ntreatment: medications:\\n If side effects occur, you can try waiting until they go away. When people first start to take atypical antipsychotics, they may become drowsy; experience dizziness when they change positions; have blurred vision; or develop a rapid heartbeat, menstrual problems, a sensitivity to the sun, or skin rashes. Many of these symptoms will go away after the first days of treatment, but people who are taking atypical antipsychotics should not drive until they adjust to their new medication.\\n\\ntreatment: medications:\\n Like diabetes or asthma, schizophrenia is a lifelong condition that needs constant attention. Although it cannot be cured, treatment can significantly improve the quality of your life. Most people with schizophrenia need to take some type of medication for the rest of their lives as well as receive other help, such as counselling/therapy.\\n\\ntreatment: medications:\\n When you have schizophrenia, it is important to take your medication regularly, because by doing so, you will have less symptoms of psychosis.Relapses (return of symptoms of psychosis) occur most often when people with schizophrenia stop taking their medication.If you want to stop taking your medication, then speak with your doctor. Your doctor can help find other options.\\n\\ntreatment: medications:\\n When you have schizophrenia, it is important to take your medication regularly, because by doing so, you will have less symptoms of psychosis.\\n\\ntreatment: medications:\\n Relapses (return of symptoms of psychosis) occur most often when people with schizophrenia stop taking their medication.\\n\\ntreatment: medications:\\n If you want to stop taking your medication, then speak with your doctor.

If you're feeling better, that's great because it means the medication is doing its job.Its hard to remember to take my medication. Ask the pharmacist at the drug store about ways to make it easier to take your medication. Common ways include:You can get a special medication pillbox that has different days of the weekYou can take your medications with mealsYou can set reminders on your alarm or watchI don't like the way the medication makes me feel; I think I may be having side effects. The good news is that often side effects go away on their own over time. But if you are having side effects that are troubling you, its better to let your doctor (or pharmacist) know about it, rather than just stop your medication.\\n\\ntreatment: medications:\\n I'm feeling better and I don't need the medication.

Many people with schizophrenia end up with problems with drugs or alcohol Getting help for these problems is very important.Work and vocational training. Because schizophrenia often strikes at the critical years of 18-35, it may stop people from being able to finish their education or find a job. Special programs geared for those with schizophrenia can help with finding work.Family Education.Patients with schizophrenia are often discharged from the hospital into the care of their families, so it is important that family members know as much as possible about schizophrenia.Counselling and therapy. Mental health professionals (such as psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, nurses or occupational therapists) can provide talk therapy.Self-Help Groups.Self-help groups for those with schizophrenia and families can provide a unique support that professionals cannot. Self-help groups are composed of \\u00a0people dealing with the same issues, and are a powerful way of getting mutual support from one another. It helps to know that you are not the only way dealing with an issue, and its helpful to be able to benefit from the knowledge of others going through the same thing.

You can help by offering to\\u00a0accompany or take your loved one to doctor's appointments. If medications have been prescribed, then support the person in taking their medications. On the other hand, if you do not feel the medications are helpful, you can tell their doctor as well.Validate feelings even if you can't validate delusions.How should you respond when someone with schizophrenia makes statements that are strange or clearly false?Because these bizarre beliefs or hallucinations are real to the patient, it will not be useful to say they are wrong or imaginary. Going along with the delusions if you do not believe it will not be helpful, either. What you can do is you can validate how the delusions make your loved one feel, and support them with that. For example, if your loved one is feeling scared from feeling that they are being followed by the CIA, then you can validate how scary that must be, and offer your support. You may have to set limits as well on what you can and cannot do.You can calmly say that you see things differently than the patient does but that you acknowledge that everyone has the right to see things in his or her own way.Don't invalidate your loved one.Even if your loved one expresses viewpoints that you completely disagree with (e.g. delusions), don't laugh or tell the other person that s/he is 'stupid' or 'crazy', nor say 'Its all in your head', as this will make the other person less interested in confiding with you. You can validate that for them, their experience feels real, and it is upsetting.Get support from people that your relative trusts.If there is a particular person that your relative trusts (and if you trust that person as well!), enlist that person's help.Reduce stress. Psychosis is made worse if the person is under a lot of stress. Help the person identify what stresses they are under, and come up with a plan to deal with each one of them.\\n\\nself-help for schizophrenia:\\n Emotional support: Give emotional support to your loved one.

It may involve an admission to hospital, or other options.\\n\\nin case of crisis: tips for families:\\n A person who does not want treatment may hide strange behavior or ideas from a professional; therefore, family members and friends can ask to speak privately with the person conducting the patient's examination and explain what has been happening at home. The professional will then be able to question the patient and hear the patient's distorted thinking for themselves. Professionals must personally witness bizarre behavior and hear delusional thoughts before they can legally recommend commitment, and family and friends can give them the information they need to do so.\\n\\nafter the crisis:\\n Caregiving. Ensuring that people with schizophrenia continue to get treatment and take their medication after they leave the hospital is also important. If patients stop taking their medication or stop going for follow-up appointments, their psychotic symptoms will return. If these symptoms become severe, they may become unable to care for their own basic needs for food, clothing, and shelter; they may neglect personal hygiene; and they may end up on the street or in jail, where they rarely receive the kind of help they need.\\n\\nafter the crisis:\\n Family and friends can also help patients set realistic goals and regain their ability to function in the world. Each step toward these goals should be small enough to be attainable, and the patient should pursue them in an atmosphere of support. People with a mental illness who are pressured and criticized usually regress and their symptoms worsen. Telling them what they are doing right is the best way to help them move forward.\\n\\nsummary:\\n Schizophrenia is a serious brain disorder that causes changes in a person's thoughts, perceptions, emotions and behaviours. It can make someone hear or see things that others cannot see. It can make someone feel unsafe, afraid, and lead to avoiding other people, and loss of function. Without proper treatment, it can cause serious problems with school, work and relationships. Fortunately, help is available for those with schizophrenia. In addition, there are many things that family and friends can do to support their loved ones with schizophrenia.\\n\\nintroduction:\\n \\\"When my sister got sick she was acting really bizarre and the police had to take her to emergency. It was really scary. My friends didn't understand at first that it was just because her brain was sick, but they do now.\\\"\\n\\nwhy is my brother or sister acting this way?:\\n Psychosis is an illness of the brain. It is caused in part by genetic (inherited) brain problems plus stress or street drugs like marijuana and crystal meth. When the brain gets ill, it is hard for the person to know what is wrong. They may make up and believe other explanations for why they feel so weird, and they may act strangely. It will be really hard for them to tell the difference between what is real and not real. Psychosis can be treated, and the earlier it is treated, the easier their recovery is likely to be.\\n\\nwill i get it too?:\\n The risk for psychosis is about three in every hundred people. If you have a sister or brother with psychosis your risk of getting it is one in ten. You have way more chance of NOT getting psychosis than of getting it. However, if sometime in the future you think you might be getting ill you can go to your family doctor for a checkup. It is also a really, really good idea to avoid using street drugs like marijuana and crystal meth, which put stress on the parts of the brain that are involved in psychosis. If there is an early psychosis service in your area, the people there can also talk to you and answer any questions you have. They might be able to put you in touch with some other siblings of people with psychosis to talk to, as well.\\n\\nwas it something i did?:\\n Psychosis is a medical illness. Sometimes when something hard happens in your life or to your family, people deal with it by blaming themselves. You don't need to. There's nothing you could have done to cause your brother or sister's illness.\\n\\nhow can i help?:\\n You can help by being around to talk, by being positive, by giving sincere compliments and by gently encouraging your brother or sister to do things they're good at. Doing one-on-one things with your brother or sister will be better than doing things in crowds. They're likely to be giving themselves a hard time about their illness. You can help by being encouraging and reminding them it's illness and they will get better.\\n\\nhow long will it take for them to get better?:\\n Nowadays, psychosis is normally treated with low doses of antipsychotic medication along with education and support for the person and their family. Once they start treatment, it can take a few months to up to a year for the person to get better. Sometimes they'll have some leftover symptoms that hang on longer. While they're recovering, they're likely to have a lot less energy to do things, be a lot quieter, need a lot more alone time, and prefer not to be in large crowds or noisy places.\\n\",\n          \"what are unexplained chronic medical symptoms?:\\n At least 35% of people at some point have physical problems that are unexplained despite seeing their doctor. Most of these are temporary and go away on their own (Steinbrecher, 2011).\\n\\nwhat are unexplained chronic medical symptoms?:\\n As many as 3% of people may suffer from persistent physical symptoms which are not life-threatening, but there is also not any obvious cause (Steinbrecher, 2011).\\n\\nwhat causes it?:\\n Heightened sensitivity: Some people are simply more sensitive to physical sensations, and may be more aware of physical signals that other people are simply not aware of.Stress: Some people may be under the effects of chronic stress. Chronic stress can cause all manner of physical and emotional symptoms, including low energy, headaches, stomach complaints, chest pain, troubles sleeping, and frequent infections. Typical stresses include work, family, and relationships.Tendency to want to avoid conflict: Some people have the strength of being kind and considerate, and are able to forego their own needs and wishes, deferring to others. Unfortunately, when a person ignores their own needs excessively, it can cause built up stress.Family history: Sometimes these conditions can run in families.\\n\\nwhat causes it?:\\n Heightened sensitivity: Some people are simply more sensitive to physical sensations, and may be more aware of physical signals that other people are simply not aware of.\\n\\nwhat causes it?:\\n Stress: Some people may be under the effects of chronic stress.

Your thoughts keep racing around in your head and the people around you are starting to avoid you because you keep snapping at them. This is stress. And most of us have been there.\\n\\nwhat is it?:\\n Stress is the response of your body and mind to demands being placed on you. When you feel threatened, your brain releases chemicals called hormones that send alarm signals throughout your body. These hormones prepare your body to take action. The hormones make your skin sweat, your breathing quicken, your heart rate go up, your muscles tense, and your senses come alive. It's this \\\"fight or flight\\\" stress response that allowed our human ancestors to survive when face to face with a threat. Unfortunately, most of our modern \\\"threats\\\" like workloads or family conflict are not situations we can easily fight with our fists or run away from. When we don\\u2019t have a healthy way to deal with stress, it can harm us more than help.\\n\\nwhat is it?:\\n Physical environments \\u2013 around you can raise your stress level. Traffic, noise (sirens keeping you up at night, a barking dog next door), and uncomfortable or unsafe living conditions can also cause stress. People who have lived through wars or natural disasters know too well the devastating impact that their environment can have on their well-being.Family and relationships \\u2013 are common daily stressors. Marital disagreements, unhealthy relationships, rebellious teens, or caring for an ill family member or a child with special needs can all send stress levels skyrocketing.Work \\u2013 can be an ever-present source of stress. Work stress is caused by things such as job dissatisfaction, an exhausting workload, insufficient pay, office politics, and conflicts with your boss or co-workers.Life situations \\u2013 can cause stress. For example, poverty, financial pressures, discrimination or harassment, unemployment, isolation, and/or a lack of social support all take a toll on your daily quality of life.Major life changes \\u2014 such as the birth of a baby, a divorce, a career change or move can also place a lot of stress on you\\u2014even if the event itself is positive.\\n\\nwhat is it?:\\n Physical environments \\u2013 around you can raise your stress level.

Stress can motivate us and push us to reach our potential. It\\u2019s stress that helps you get through that presentation to your clients or forces us to do homework when we\\u2019d rather take a nap. Stress is very individual. What you find stressful may not be stressful for someone else.\\n\\nwhat is it?:\\n It\\u2019s important to know that stress in itself is not a mental illness. But when the stress keeps piling up and it starts to make you feel worse instead of motivating you, it can harm your mental health and well-being. Stress is a risk factor for someone who is already vulnerable to developing a mental illness. Stress can affect us physically too. In high amounts stress can, for example, cause high blood pressure and make it hard for your body to fight off infections.\\n\\nwho does it affect?:\\n Stress affects most of us. In a recent international poll, three-quarters of Canadians said they experienced stress in their daily lives either frequently or fairly often . But stress can affect some people differently than others:\\n\\nwho does it affect?:\\n Women \\u2013 are more likely than men to report feeling stressed. Men and women also report reacting to different kinds of stress. Women tend to react more to chronic stressors like time constraints, meeting others' expectations, marital relationships, children, and family health. Men, on the other hand, are more affected by work-related stressors like a change in job, demotion, pay cut, and financial difficulties.Youth \\u2013 are doing more today than ever before, balancing school with other activities, friends and jobs. All of these responsibilities can lead to stress. In one survey, one in 10 teens reported regularly feeling very stressed with not having enough time in the day.Older adults \\u2013 face stressors like major illness, changes in routine and income related to retirement, physical changes, the death of a spouse and a shrinking circle of friends. All of these stressors can contribute to increased levels of stress in Canada\\u2019s elderly.People with chronic illnesses \\u2013 like diabetes, arthritis or heart disease can experience extreme stress because they worry about their illness, their treatments and the effect that the illness will have on themselves and those around them.\\n\\nwho does it affect?:\\n Women \\u2013 are more likely than men to report feeling stressed.

There are some things that you can do to figure out how to best deal with your stress:\\n\\nwhat can i do about it?:\\n Find out what stresses you the most: If you need to, make a list of everything that\\u2019s on your mind. You can\\u2019t do anything to stop your stress until you know what causes it.Problem solve: Deal with problems effectively. Life problems, like financial issues, family conflicts or problems at work can be a huge cause of stress. Learning to deal with problems properly can make a big difference. There are a number of steps to problem solving:Identify the problemSet some goalsMake a list of possible solutionsChoose a solution from your listPut your solution into actionTrack your progressDon\\u2019t procrastinate: Don\\u2019t put off the things you need to do. Keeping a daily planner can help keep you organized and on track. Focus on tasks as well as decisions. Putting off making decisions can cause unnecessary stress and worry.Talk about it: Sometimes we just need to vent. Talk to someone you can trust. If your school, workplace or faith community offers counseling, take advantage of it.Share your work load: Delegate your responsibilities. This doesn\\u2019t mean offload all your work onto those around you but only take on what you need to. This applies at home too: ask family and friends for help.Self-care: Exercise, meditation or prayer, getting a good night\\u2019s sleep, eating well, petting your dog or cat, going for a walk, laughing and stretching\\u2014all of these are great stress relievers. Unfortunately, they are also sometimes the first things we stop doing when we feel under pressure.Just say no: You can\\u2019t please everybody. If you feel like you can\\u2019t take on a task, don\\u2019t be afraid to say so. If you find it hard to say no, read books or attend classes on how to be more assertive. Being assertive will help you communicate your needs firmly but nicely.\\n\\nwhat can i do about it?:\\n Find out what stresses you the most: If you need to, make a list of everything that\\u2019s on your mind.
