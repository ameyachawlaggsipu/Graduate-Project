Things\\ndon't have to be this way. Help is available, whether through speaking with your physician, or\\ncalling a telephone crisis line, or a woman's shelter.\\nWhat is Abuse and Domestic Violence?\\nAbuse is behaviour used to intimidate, isolate, dominate or control another person. It may be a pattern of\\nbehaviour or it may be a single incident. Abusive behaviour might involve acts or words or even neglect.\\n \\nAbuse can be physical, sexual, emotional, psychological or ﬁnancial:\\nPhysical abuse is when someone hurts you physically in any way. It includes hitting, kicking,\\nslapping, pinching, cutting, stabbing, and shooting. All of these examples are assault , which is a crime in\\nCanada and the United States.\\nSexual touching or sexual activity is abuse  if you do not consent or if you are too young to consent -\\nthis is also a crime in both Canada and the United States. It does not matter if you are dating someone,\\nliving with someone or married to someone; if you do not consent, or if you are too young to consent, it is a\\ncrime.\\nEmotional or psychological abuse  is when someone purposely does things to make you feel bad about\\nyourself. It includes threats to hurt you or loved ones; constant insults or put downs; hurting your children,\\nyour pets or threatening to do so; driving dangerously with you in the car; isolating you from friends and\\nfamily. Stalking is when someone just won't leave you alone. Stalking behaviours include when someone\\nfollows, watches or tracks where you go; leaves threatening messages; harasses you with too many\\nmessages; calling you over and over again, and hangs up with no answer; sends gifts you do not want.\\nFinancial abuse  is whenever someone takes advantage of your money. It includes: taking your pay cheque\\nor money without permission; Keeping your money so that you cannot pay for things you or your children\\nneed, such as food, shelter or medical treatment; making you sign documents to sell your house or to\\nchange your will. These are crimes in Canada.\\nBullying is a form of abuse that can happen in a relationship or in a family. It may be physical, sexual, emotional,\\npsychological, ﬁnancial, or a combination. Some forms of bullying may be crimes.\\n \\nSome examples of bullying may be:\\nHitting, kicking, pushing or shoving\\nTaking your money and other possessions\\nMaking threats or acting in an intimidating way\\nConstantly teasing you or calling you names\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Abuse and Domestic Violence.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Just as with abuse, aggression can take many\\nforms, such as: \\nPhysical: When your partner hits, kicks, punches or hurts you physically in any way.\\nEmotional: When your partner controls you by saying or doing things which may you feel down about\\nyourself.\\nSexual: Making someone do sexual things that they do not want to, including rape.\\nIt Doesn't Have to Happen Regularly\\nAbuse or aggression does not have to happen regularly. It can happen just once in a while. And after an abuse\\nhappens, the other person may go out of his/her way in being nice and promising that it won't happen it again...\\nBut unfortunately, the abuse usually does happen again...\\nAbuse Can Start at Any Time\\nThe abuse also doesn't have to start oﬀ at the beginning of the relationship. Usually the abuser is sweet and\\ncharming in the beginning. But over time, the abuser may show subtle signs of controlling the other person, such\\nas by needing to know the other person's whereabouts, or by being extremely jealous.\\nAbuse is always wrong\\nYou have a right to safety, respect, and a life free from harm by others. Abuse and domestic violence\\nis not only wrong but is also against the law.\\n \\nAnd although abusers are often very good at blaming their victims for the abuse, the abuse is always\\nthe abuser's responsibility. It is NEVER your fault.\\nMyths and Facts about Abuse\\nUnfortunately, guilt and shame often keeps victims in an abusive relationship; it stops them from getting help from\\nthemselves.\\n \\nMyth: I deserve it. I'm not a perfect person myself.\\nFact: It is true; maybe you aren't a perfect person yourself, but there nothing you do deserves abuse.\\n \\nMyth: If I stay, I can help him/her to work it out.\\nFact: You are a partner, not a therapist. And the longer you stay in an abusive relationship, the less motivation the\\nother person has to change.

If\\nyou stay together in an abusive relationship, then you increase the chance that you or your kids will get seriously\\nharmed at some point. Furthermore, your kids will only learn that abusive relationships are normal, which will\\nmake it more likely that your kids will have abusive relationships when they grow up.

The place that you decide to go must be within the same province or\\nterritory in which you are living until custody is decided by a judge.\\n \\nIf you have time, before leaving your home, you should also speak with a lawyer about the best way to protect\\nyourself and your children. A lawyer can help you apply to the court for a custody or parenting order*.\\n \\nIf you are worried about your children's safety, your lawyer can ask the judge for an order that would allow your\\nspouse to have only supervised visits with the children, or in very rare cases, no contact at all. The judge will base\\ntheir decision on what is best for the children. Keep in mind that it is rare for a judge to order no contact between a\\nchild and a parent. The other parent will likely be able to visit the children but the judge may order supervised\\nvisits with another person present, such as a social worker. If your children will be visiting the other parent, you\\nmay want to arrange for someone else to be there for the pickups and returns to prevent any problems.\\n \\nYour safety and the safety of your children come ﬁrst. Do not stay in a dangerous situation because you are\\nworried about how you will support your children on your own.

As a result, it can make life very stressful. The good news, is that there are\\nmany strategies and medications that can help ADHD. Remember the classic strengths of\\nADHD… high energy, passion and enthusiasm for things that interest you, being creative and\\nspontaneous.\\nNotice Any of the Following?\\nDo you notice of the following in yourself (or your loved one): \\nHave trouble focusing on things like reading, schoolwork and tasks?\\nHave troubles paying attention in class?\\nHave problems getting homework or assignments done?\\nGet easily distracted?\\nOften lose things that you need?\\nTend to act impulsively or without thinking?\\nIf so, you might have ADD/ADHD, a brain condition that makes it hard for people to focus. If you have ADD/ADHD,\\nthere is good news! There are many things that can help you pay attention, and make life easier.\\nWhat is Attention Deﬁcit Disorder (ADD) and Attention Deﬁcit\\nHyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)?\\nEveryone has a hard time paying attention from time to time, especially when doing things we feel are a little\\nboring. For people living with ADD or ADHD, trouble paying attention is so severe that it causes problems at home,\\nschool, work and other areas.\\n \\nResearchers have learned that the brains of people with ADD/ADHD are wired a bit diﬀerently compared to people\\nwho don’t have ADD/ADHD. The diﬀerence is mostly in the brain’s frontal lobe (just behind your forehead).\\n \\nThis part of the brain:\\nOrganizes thoughts;\\nHelps us to focus and change focus;\\nRemembers details;', metadata={'source': './content/docs/ADD ADHD_ Youth Edition.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

People with\\nADD tend to get easily distracted. This makes it harder to keep your focus when\\nyou’re doing dull things, like homework or chores. Quite often, you end up\\ndaydreaming or get distracted by less important things.\\n \\nPeople with this type of ADHD may ﬁnd it hard to:\\n• Pay attention to just one source of information;\\n• Follow directions or remember details;\\n• Complete tasks that are long, have many steps and/or boring;\\n• Complete things on time or arrive on time for appointments.\\nPeople can have ADD without really knowing. And others don’t notice it so\\nmuch, because you’re not hyperactive.\\nAttention Deﬁcit Hyperactivity\\nDisorder - Primarily Hyperactive\\nImpulsiveWith this type of ADHD, it may be easier for you to pay attention and focus. But\\nit’s harder for you to control your activity level and impulses.\\n \\nHyperactivity: You tend to have so much energy that you often need to move or\\nﬁdget. This is diﬃcult when people expect you to sit still for a long time, like in\\nclass, at the dinner table or during downtime.\\n \\nPeople who are hyperactive might:\\n• Have trouble staying seated when that is expected;\\n• Need to move or ﬁdget (pacing, tapping feet, drumming);\\n• Find it hard to calm down.\\nImpulsivity: You tend to do things before thinking them through. As a result, you\\nmight make more mistakes because you haven’t thought ahead about the\\nimpact of your actions. So you might:\\n• Have trouble waiting patiently;\\n• React quickly when you’re upset;\\n• Talk too much or interrupt others when they are speaking;\\n• Take more risks (for example, physical stunts, sexual activities, drugs and\\nalcohol).\\nAttention Deﬁcit Hyperactivity\\nDisorder (ADHD, or combined type)This is the most common type. It includes all the traits of the ﬁrst two. In other\\nwords:\\n• Attention deﬁcit;\\n• Hyperactivity;\\n• Impulsivity.  \\n \\nPeople with any type of ADHD may also have problems with:\\nDisorganization: Losing or misplacing things. This happens because you get easily distracted and have\\ntrouble paying attention to what you are doing. So you may:\\nForget to ﬁnish or hand in homework, projects and tasks;\\nHave trouble managing your time and are often late for things;\\nForget things like where your keys are, important dates and directions someone has given you.\\nFrustration and Mood Swings. It can be hard to cope with ADHD, and frustration and emotional ups and\\ndowns are common. It is normal to feel these emotions.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/ADD ADHD_ Youth Edition.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 3 / 8\\nBeing easily bored. Everyone needs stimulation, but with ADHD, you often need high levels of non-stop\\nstimulation. Your senses (sights, sounds, touch, smell, taste) constantly crave more stimulation and your\\nbody is yelling at you to move.\\nWhat Causes ADHD?\\nThere’s no single cause for ADHD. It comes from a mix of factors that we have little control over, like:\\n \\nFamily History\\n • ADHD is more likely if you have family members living with it.\\n• 8 out of 10 people with ADHD will have close family members who also have ADHD.\\nBrain diﬀerences There are diﬀerences between the brains of people who live with ADHD and those who don’t such as:\\n• The shape and size of the brain;\\n• Brain chemicals (lower levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in people with ADHD);\\n• Brain activity (less brain activity in the frontal part of the brain in people with ADHD).\\nAnother Way to Look at ADHD: The Hunter Hypothesis\\nSome researchers believe there is another way to think about ADHD. They suggest that ADHD traits in people\\nhelped human groups to survive as hunter-gatherers. This was long ago before humans began to farm and create\\nvillages, towns and cities.\\n \\nA good hunter would need to be:\\nAware of everything in his or her surroundings;\\nAble to act or respond quickly;\\nEnergetic for chasing and hunting.\\nIt is thanks to people with these traits that humans survived. We were able to settle in one place to farm and\\nestablish towns and cities. And while the way we live has changed, many people still carry these ‘hunter’ traits.\\nModern life doesn’t always suit the hunters among us. Hunters don’t get to spend their time outside; watching,\\nlistening, stalking or chasing. Like most of us, they spend most of the time inside, sitting.\\n \\nWhen you ask hunters to sit still for long periods, it is then that they appear:\\nDistractible;\\nImpulsive;\\nHyperactive.\\nThis way of thinking about ADHD can also help us to see the strengths of ADHD.\\n \\nThe ‘up’ side of ADHD\\n \\nWhile ADHD can be viewed as a disability, it doesn’t mean that it’s all bad. With time, we’ve come to see that it’s\\nmore a diﬀerent way of doing things. We do know that people with ADHD do well in certain environments. With\\ntime, you’ll learn to manage your symptoms to your advantage. Here are a few examples of traits you might\\nrecognize in yourself:\\n \\nHigh energy, active\\nand “hands on”:People with ADHD often excel in situations where a lot is going on at once. They learn to pay\\nattention to many things at the same time and good at ‘mulit-tasking’.

They are often attracted to\\ncareers like:\\n• Policing;\\n• Fireﬁghting;\\n• Working in the emergency department;\\n• Being a paramedic;\\n• Armed forces;\\n• Teaching.\\nEnergized by change People with ADHD often  ﬁnd change exciting, and will seek out new and interesting\\nexperiences. This also helps them to adapt and thrive in many diﬀerent situations. When faced\\nwith change, they often respond by showing they can be:\\n• Persistent;\\n• Resourceful;\\n• Outgoing;\\n• Ready for action;\\n• Good at improvising;\\n• Good in crisis situations.\\nCreative People with ADHD can be very innovative and full of ideas. This may be helpful in:\\n• Design;\\n• The arts;\\n• The entertainment industry;\\n• Technology and innovation.\\nI Think I Have ADHD: What Can I Do? \\nADD/ADHD is quite common so you are not alone! A good ﬁrst step is a visit to your family doctor if you think you\\nhave ADHD symptoms, and they are getting in the way of your daily activities like school, work and keeping\\npositive relationships with friends and family.\\n \\nYour family doctor will help decide if you have ADHD, or if you need to see another professional. Figuring out the\\ntype of ADD/ADHD early will also help to make sure you get the right help to meet your needs and take positive\\nsteps in your life.\\n \\nYour family doctor will check to see if your symptoms could be caused by other things, like:\\nLow iron in your blood;\\nHormone imbalances;\\nNot enough omega 3 fatty acids in your diet;\\nExposure to lead or mercury;\\nCertain food or environmental sensitivities;\\nBeing gifted or being bored;\\nHearing, vision or movement problems;\\nLearning or language disability;\\nMood disorders like anxiety or depression.\\nTreatments for ADD/ADHD\\nThere are many ways to manage ADD/ADHD. Treatment options depend on how severe your ADHD is. A\\ncombination of medication, an adapted school learning plan and counselling can be very eﬀective and help you\\nreach your potential. But everyone is diﬀerent, you may not need all of these treatments.\\nTreatment for ADD/ADHD: Medication\\nAlthough some people are concerned about using medication for ADHD, research shows clearly that the right type', metadata={'source': './content/docs/ADD ADHD_ Youth Edition.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

When it’s easier to manage your symptoms, it’s easier to learn at school. It’s also\\neasier to use other strategies to control your symptoms. This could allow you to manage your symptoms without\\nmedication in the future. Medication doesn’t have to be permanent. Ask your doctor about the diﬀerent types of\\nmedication as well as the advantages and disadvantages.\\nTreatment for ADD/ADHD: Non-Medication Strategies\\nDiet\\n Changes in diet don’t bring the same improvements as medication, but some people ﬁnd that the kind of\\nfood they eat can make ADHD symptoms better or worse. Some studies suggest that a lack of Omega 3\\nfatty acids, (found in ﬁsh and nuts) could make ADHD symptoms worse. Some people may be sensitive to\\ncertain food additives that may get turned into brain chemicals that “excite” the brain too much and may\\nwish to avoid:\\n• Artiﬁcial sweeteners, for example:\\n• Aspartame (e.g. Nutrasweet®, Equal®);\\n• Acesulfame Potassium (Sunett® and Sweet One®);\\n• Saccharin ( Sweet’N Low®).\\n• MSG (monosodium glutamate), often found in:\\n• Many restaurants and fast foods;\\n• Many packaged processed food.\\n• Caﬀeine and energy drinks\\n• Caﬀeine found in drinks like Pop, coﬀee and Red Bull® can make you feel more restless and\\nhyperactive by boosting your energy level for a short time.\\n• Artiﬁcial food coloring, often found in:\\n• Kool-Aid®;\\n• Jell-O®;\\n• Fruit drinks like Hi-C®.\\nA varied, balanced diet that includes more home cooked meals and unprocessed food will be better for\\nyour body and brain. Eating regular meals and snacks will also help a lot. Contact your doctor or a trained\\ndietician to learn more about nutrition and how it impacts your body.\\nDaily\\nexercise in\\nnatureHaving enough exercise every day will help you to use some of your excess energy in a positive way.\\nSome studies show that people are able to focus better after physical activity. For example, biking to\\nschool can help you to focus in the morning. Try:\\n• Active transportation (walk, bike or rollerblade to where you need to go);\\n• Joining a sports team or other activiy (like swimming, dancing or gymnastics);\\n• A ﬁtness or yoga class;\\n• Working out at a gym.\\nSelf-Regulation in ADHD\\nPeople with ADHD tend to do better in situations that stimulate them “just right”. This could be one reason why\\nadults notice improvement in their symptoms, when they ﬁnd a job that is just right for them.\\n \\nFinding situations that oﬀer the right amount of stimulation will allow you to perform at your best. It might take\\nsome time to get it just right, as this is diﬀerent for everyone and is a question of ‘feel’. For example, people who\\nneed lots of movement may be in a situation where they can’t move around the way they’d like.\\n \\nUnderstanding their own needs, they could plan to have ﬁdget tools or other strategies ready to help them focus\\non the task at hand. Other ideas for adding the right amount of stimulation to help with focus:\\n \\nRemember: There can be a ﬁne line between getting just enough stimulation, and being overstimulated and\\ndistracted.

Fortunately, there are many things that parents and\\ncaregivers can do to support their youth. This includes proactively spending one on one time\\nwith your child/youth, to build up a close, trusting relationship where your child/youth can feel\\ncomfortable talking to you, without fear of getting in trouble. Should you be concerned however,\\ndo not hesitate to see a professional (such as a family physician or paediatrician) to talk about\\nyour concerns.\\nDavid\\'s Story\\nUp until this school year, David was a regular teen who goes to school and hanging out with his friends. Recently,\\nhe\\'s been moody and irritable all the time. His grades have been dropping, and his parents are certain that he\\'s\\ncome home intoxicated or high at least a few times. His parents wonder about drug problems, but they just don\\'t\\nknow what to do. David\\'s been so irritable and withdrawn  that everyone in the family feels like they\\'re walking on\\neggshells....\\nWhat are Alcohol and Substance Use Problems?\\nMany children and youth have tried drugs and alcohol. Surveys have reported that by the end of high school, 80%\\nof students have tried alcohol, 49% have tried marijuana, and 29% have used a street drug other than marijuana\\n(Johnston, 2002).\\n \\n\"What\\'s the harm? Don\\'t a lot of people try drugs or alcohol?\"\\n \\nAlthough many youth who try alcohol or substances will not go on to develop problems with addiction, there is a\\nsizeable percentage that do go onto develop problems. According to the study Drug Use Among Ontario Students:\\n1977-2007 : \\n61% of students have tried alcohol, and 29% have tried illicit drugs (street drugs such as marijuana). \\n19% of students have hazardous levels of alcohol use, and 15% have drug use to the point where it is\\ncausing problems. \\nAlcohol and drug use is something to be concerned about because it is linked to a variety of problems such as:\\nEarly sexual activity\\nSkipping or dropping out of school', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Alcohol and Substance Use in Youth.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

A person is dependent when they must keep using alcohol/drugs in order\\nto keep from having withdrawal symptoms, and if they miss having alcohol/drugs, their body goes into\\nwithdrawal.\\nCommon Drugs\\nCommon substances that can be abused include:\\nAlcohol: Used because it can often cause pleasurable feelings as well as reduce anxiety and/or stress.\\nUnfortunately, excess use can cause mood and anxiety problems, impair memory, coordination and\\njudgement.\\nMarijuana: Used by people because it can cause temporary pleasurable feelings. Unfortunately, continued\\nuse leads to problems with concentration, learning and even paranoia. \\nStimulants: Stimulants are a class of medications which include amphetamines. methylphenidate (aka\\nRitalin), as well as caﬀeine. Cocaine and crack are also found in this category. Stimulants are used because\\nthey can (temporarily) improve mood, and increase energy, alertness and concentration. Indeed,\\nprescription stimulants such as Methylphenidate can be very helpful for certain conditions, as long it is\\nmonitored by a doctor. Unfortunately, stimulant abuse can lead to depression, mood problems, and\\nparanoia.\\nInhalants: Inhalants are chemical vapors that you breathe that cause mind-altering eﬀects which some\\npeople ﬁnd enjoyable. Unfortunately, inhalants damage brain cells along with other vital organs such as the\\nheart, kidneys, liver and muscles.\\nHallucinogens: Hallucinogens include drugs such as LSD (acid), psilocybin (mushrooms), ecstacy and\\nketamine. They are used to create mild ti intense mind-altering eﬀects including changes in perception,\\nfeelings of emotional warmth and energy. Unfortunately, negative eﬀects can include terrifying\\nhallucinations, severe depression, overheating and death\\nOpioids: Opioids are a class of medications which include morphine, codine, oxycodone as well as street\\ndrugs such as heroin. They are used because they can (temporarily) create feelings of euphoria or extreme\\nhappiness. Doctors may prescribe opioids to relieve pain. Unfortunately, opioid abuse can lead to nausea,\\nphysical dependence, mood problems, and death.\\nWhy Do People Use Drugs?\\nPeople can use alcohol and drugs for diﬀerent reasons. Its easier to help someone with alcohol and drug use if you\\nﬁgure out their reasons because then you can 1) agree with them on their reason (i.e. their goal) for using (which\\nhelps form trust with them), and 2) then ﬁnd a healthier to get to that same goal.\\n \\nCommon reasons (and corresponding solutions) include:\\nBoredom, curiosity, and desire for fun.

If so, its actually a good thing -- now you can do\\nsomething about it.\\nTo deal with an underlying condition such as depression, anxiety, insomnia, or poor concentration.\\nUnfortunately, although a street drug may help temporarily, they invariably cause more problems in the\\nlong run. Examples include the depressed teenager who uses ‘ecstasy' and marijuana to improve his mood.\\nThe university student with anxiety and insomnia that copes by using alcohol. Or the high school student\\nwho discovers that nicotine and marijuana help improve his focus. If this is the case, then it would be\\nimportant to ﬁnd healthier ways to deal with any underlying condition. Start by seeing your child's\\nphysician.\\nPrevention\\nStudies show that many teens will at least experiment with alcohol and drugs. Don't be discouraged; there many\\nthings that parents and caregivers can do to reduce the risk:\\nLearn what you can about drugs and drug use in children and youth. There are many good websites\\nfor this, such as the National Institute for Drug Abuse in Bethesda, Maryland (www.nida.nih.gov) or the\\nCentre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto,Ontario (www.camh.net). See the end of this article for\\nmore links.\\n \\nBuild a good relationship with your children BEFORE they are teenagers. Spend positive quality\\ntime with them while they are still young and want to spend time with you!\\n \\nEat at least 1 meal a day together as a family. This can deﬁnitely be challenging with today's busy\\nschedules, but is important. Studies have shown that families which have at least one meal a day together,\\nhave children who are less likely to have drug or alcohol problems (though it is not yet known whether this\\nis actually a cause or eﬀect).\\n \\nLearn ‘how to talk so your children will listen, and how to listen so that your children will talk' ...\\nAllow them to talk about their feelings freely. Don't lecture or give long monologues. Create a supportive\\nenvironment so that your children will feel comfortable talking about the stresses and issues that they face.\\n \\nBuild self-esteem and self-conﬁdence in your child , which will help your children resist peer pressure\\nand be able to ‘say no'.\\n \\nLook for persistance, and praise it . Find times when your child has worked hard at something, no matter\\nwhat the outcome. If your child succeeds, then praise your child, but emphasize the eﬀort, not the outcome.\\nFor example, if your child studies hard and gets good marks, emphasize the hard work, not the good marks.\\nSimilarly, if your child works hard but gets a poor mark, nonetheless remember to still praise the eﬀort.\\nThis teaches your child the importance of hard work and persistence, which in the long run, is the more\\nimportant strength to have.\\nIf you do need to give constructive criticism, then criticize the behaviours or actions, and not your child. It's\\nthe behaviour that needs changing; not your child.\\n \\nTeach your child the ability to make his/her own decisions.

Communicate clearly what you expect about drug use, and what the\\nconsequences of use will be.\\nYou will need to think about:\\n \\nWhat are your expectations around drug use? Are you willing to tolerate some experimentation? Are you\\nwilling to allow your child the opportunity to use alcohol under supervised situations? On the other hand,\\nyou may have a zero tolerance policy. \\nWhat are you going to set as consequences? Removal of privileges? Grounding? For how long? And if you do\\nset a consequence, make sure its something you can enforce, because otherwise you lose credibility. For\\nexample, setting a rule that your child has no contact with a certain classmate at school may seem\\nreasonable theory, but be careful about setting that rule if you cant enforce it.\\n \\nModel how you want your children to behave.  Actions speak louder than words. Always ask yourself,\\n\"What message am I sending to my children?\"\\nFor example:\\nDon\\'t use any street drugs yourself.\\nDon\\'t brag, or tell ‘war stories\\' about your own alcohol or drug use, either now, or in the old days. (If\\nyou really want to tell them, at least wait until they are adults...)\\nBe aware of your own alcohol or drug use, even if for legal substances. For example:\\nDo you oﬀer alcohol to guests when they visit? Have your children ever seen you drunk? Do\\nyou ever drink and drive yourself?\\nDo you ever use medications for minor aches or pains? If so, what are your children learning?\\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, then ask yourself: What are my children\\nlearning?\\nDon\\'t wait until you have \"the drug talk\" with your child. Talk about alcohol and drugs on a regular\\nbasis. When the theme of substances comes up (either on television, in movies or in real-life), take\\nadvantage of these situations to talk about drugs with your child. For example, if you see a drunk\\nperson in a movie or in a restaurant, talk about it afterwards with your child.\\nEducate your child about common myths such as \"everybody drinks\" or \"marijuana won\\'t hurt you.\"\\nWork together with the other parent. Regardless of whether or not you are still together with the\\nother parent, do your best to talk with the other parent so that you can both send a consistent\\nmessage to your child about drug use.\\nWork with others in your community, such as parents and the school.

In other words, if someone gets drunk at the party, and you let him/her drive\\nhome, and if s/he gets into an accident, then you are responsible.\\n \\nHelp your child to understand that s/he is ethically responsible for this too , so that s/he can help\\nyou with enforcing limits to keep people safe. Guests who bring tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs to the party\\nshould be asked to leave.\\n \\nIf people show up intoxicated or end up intoxicated , call their parents to make sure they get safely\\nhome.\\n \\nBe there.  Ideally, ﬁnd a spot where you can be at the party, such as by helping to serve food and drink.\\nOtherwise, be nearby somewhere else in the home.\\nIf Your Teen Is Going to a Party:\\nOne common recommendation to parents is that you call the host\\'s parent to oﬀer your help\\nwith the party (which at the same time helps conﬁrm that there is a party) . At the same time, you\\ncould ask whether or not there will be a responsible adult around, and what the alcohol/drug policy will be.\\nBecause this is often not possible however, another option is the following...\\n \\nTalk to your teen about the party and problem-solve together. In the spirit of encouraging your\\nteen\\'s own judgement, talk together about the party, about possible risks, and how to deal with them. If the\\nrisks were too high, then it might be better to not go at all.\\n \\n‘Do you know where your child is?\\'  Ask for the address and phone number for the party. Have your teen\\ncall you if the location of the party changes.\\n \\nDoes your teen know where you are? Let your child know where you will be during the party.\\n \\nEnsure your teen has an exit strategy. Make it easy for your teen to leave the party at anytime, for\\nexample by making it easy for your teen to call you at any time, e.g. cell phone or change for a phone call.\\nRemind your youth to NEVER to ride with a driver who has been drinking or using drugs.\\n \\nStay up and greet your teen when he or she gets home , so that you can ﬁnd how s/he is doing and\\nabout how the party went. If your teen doesn\\'t want to talk about it right then and there, then ﬁnd some\\nother mutually agreeable time.\\nGeneral Advice to Give to Teenagers\\nHang out with people who don\\'t smoke, drink, or use other drugs.\\n \\nUse the \"buddy system\" -- team up with a friend. Use a code word to remind each other when it\\'s time to\\nleave a party.\\n \\nIf you (as a teen) like to meet new people, suggest trying some of the following activities instead of parties:\\nFree concerts\\nSchool dances\\nAny sort of extracurricular activities\\nSports\\nVolunteer work\\nPart-time job\\nYouth group through church or religious group\\nIn the end, you cannot guarantee that your child will always be in a drug-free environment, and you can\\'t be there\\nto monitor your child 24/7.

These people often\\nbelieve that only “alcoholics,” people who are dependent on alcohol, cause car accidents or bar brawls. They\\nbelieve that because they are not dependent themselves, they can drink freely without worrying about the\\nconsequences. But the truth is that moderate drinkers cause as much damage as heavy drinkers.\\n \\nMany moderate drinkers—particularly those who sometimes drink to the point of intoxication—walk a ﬁne line\\nbetween living normal, productive lives and living recklessly, wearing down the faith and patience of family, friends\\nand co-workers.\\n \\nMost moderate drinkers could beneﬁt from cutting down on their alcohol intake. Some would be wise to consider\\nquitting drinking altogether.

For example, someone3.\\nputting you down, hitting you or forcing you to do something you do not want to do.\\nUnfairness: Being treated unfairly can also trigger anger. For example, being blamed for failing to meet a4.\\ndeadline at work when it was actually the fault of your co-worker.\\nHow do I know if my anger is a problem?\\nAnger becomes a problem if it is:\\nToo frequent: Sometimes anger is appropriate and useful in pushing us to solve problems.

Even if your anger is justiﬁed, you will feel better if you pick only your most important\\nbattles and let go of the rest.\\nToo intense: Very intense anger is rarely a good thing. Anger triggers an adrenalin response and all kinds of2.\\nphysiological reactions (e.g., heart pumps faster, breathing increases, etc.).

It\\ncan also freeze us in our tracks. Like it or not, anxiety is an intense state that we all experience from time to time.\\n \\nAnxiety aﬀects us physically, emotionally and in all aspects of our life situations. Normally, it plays an important\\nrole in survival. When we encounter a threatening situation, our bodies prepare for danger by producing more\\nadrenaline and increasing the blood ﬂow and heart rate, among other things. This instinctive \"ﬁght or ﬂight\"\\nresponse can help a person survive a physical attack or an earthquake, for example.\\n \\nNevertheless, most modern \"dangers\" such as unemployment are not ones a person can ﬁght with their ﬁsts or run\\naway from. With no outlet for release, the body may remain in a state of constant mental and physical alertness\\nthat can be extremely draining over the long term.\\n \\nWhen anxiety persists for weeks and months, when it develops into a relentless sense of dread or starts to\\ninterfere with a person\\'s daily life, then anxiety has moved beyond the realm of ordinary anxiety. When a person\\nhas this degree of anxiety, outside help can be required to feel safe again.\\n ', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Anxiety in Adults.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Depending on its intensity, anxiety can make people feel trapped in their\\nhomes, too frightened to even open the door.\\nHow Common is Anxiety?\\nAnxiety is the most common mental health condition, and aﬀects about 12% of the population in Western countries\\nin any given year.\\nWhat Contributes to Anxiety?\\nA number of diﬀerent factors can increase the risk of developing an anxiety disorder including past experiences,\\nlearned behaviours (e.g. avoidant coping style) and a genetic predisposition, to name a few. There is not one single\\ncause and it is usually a combination of these types of risk factors that lead to the onset of an anxiety disorder for\\nany one individual.\\nCommon Types of Anxiety\\n1. Panic Attacks\\nPanic attacks involve a sudden onset of intense apprehension, fear and terror, as well as feelings of\\nimpending doom. These attacks may cause shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, trembling and shaking, a\\nfeeling of disconnectedness from reality and even a fear of dying. Though they last only a short time, panic\\nattacks are frightening experiences that may increase in frequency if left untreated.\\n2. Phobias\\nPeople with phobias have overwhelming feelings of terror or panic when confronted with a feared object,\\nsituation or activity. It is interesting to note that we probably evolved to have many of these phobias\\nbecause having \\'just enough\\' of them probably helped with human survival in the early days. For example,\\nhaving a fear of spiders and snakes would be healthy because it probably helped our ancestors avoid\\ndangerous, poisonous spiders and snakes.\\nTypes of phobias include:\\nClaustrophobia (Fear of enclosed spaces)\\nAviophobia (Fear of ﬂying)\\nArachnophobia (Fear of spiders)\\nOphiophobia (Fear of snakes)\\nAgoraphobia (fear of crowded places): individuals with agoraphobia feel terriﬁed of being in crowded\\nsituations or public places, or any situation where help is not immediately available. Their anxiety\\nmay become so intense that they fear they will faint, have a heart attack or lose control. These\\npeople often avoid any situation in which escape may be diﬃcult (e.g., in an airplane), impossible or\\nembarrassing. In some cases, people with agoraphobia may become house-bound for years.\\n3. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)\\nOCD is a condition where individuals have obsessions and/or compulsions.\\nObsessions are recurrent, unpleasant thoughts (such as \"I am dirty\"), which leads to a behaviour (such as\\nrepeated handwashing) as a way to reduce the anxiety of the obsession. Washing one\\'s hands provides a\\nmomentary respite from the anxiety of the obsessive thought, but since the relief is usually short-lived, the\\ncompulsive behaviour is often repeated over and over. People caught in this cycle may wash their hands\\nrepeatedly until the skin is rubbed raw.\\nCommon obsessions include: recurring thoughts of speciﬁc images, numbers or words.\\nCommon compulsions include repeatedly checking that a door is locked or that a stove is switched oﬀ. \\n \\n4. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Anxiety in Adults.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Page 3 / 4\\nSome people who have survived a severe and often violent physical or mental trauma may have a sense of\\nreliving the trauma many years later. They may develop post-traumatic stress disorder, which involves re-\\nexperiencing traumatic events such as a car crash, rape or a life-threatening robbery through nightmares,\\nnight terrors or ﬂashbacks.\\nAmong the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder are numbing one's self emotionally, experiencing an\\noverall sense of anxiety and dread or feeling plagued by guilt about one's own survival. War veterans are\\nparticularly vulnerable to this form of anxiety which can aﬀect one's memory and ability to concentrate and\\nsleep\\nWhat Can I Do About Anxiety?\\nThe good news is that there are many things that can be done about anxiety. There are many self-help strategies\\ncan be used to help oneself cope with anxiety. \\nGet enough sleep. Lack of sleep can contribute to anxiety problems, because lack of sleep is a stress on\\nyour body. Try your best to get at least 8-10 hours of sleep.  \\nEat a healthy diet. Try your best to eat a healthy diet, because studies show that diets rich in processed\\nfoods or fast foods can contribute to mood and anxiety problems. \\nGet enough exercise. Throughout most of human history, human beings moved throughout most of the day.\\nIn our modern society, we are largely sedentary, which is out of balance with the original conditions we\\nevolved under. Try your best to walk or stand whenever possible, rather than sit. Try your best to get at\\nleast 30-60 minutes a day of walking or other exercise.\\nLearn to meditate and practice mindfulness. The practice of mindfulness, which is learning how to focus\\nyour mind on the present, and clear out distracting, anxiety provoking thoughts, has been proven to be a\\npowerful intervention for anxiety. Learn yoga and how to breathe and meditate.\\nLearn about cognitive behaviour strategies for anxiety such as:\\nIdentify the worry thoughts that make you anxious. Replace those worry thoughts with more helpful\\nthoughts. \\nExpose yourself gradually to feared situations. \\nWhen to See a Professional\\nIf your anxiety does not improve on its own, then the good news is that there are various professionals that can\\nhelp with your anxiety.\\n \\nStart by seeing your family physician, who can help make sure that there aren't any medical conditions\\ncontributing to your anxiety.  \\n \\nYour family physician may be able to provide counseling/therapy for anxiety, and/or refer you to someone who can,\\nsuch as a psychologist, social worker, or certiﬁed counselor/therapist. \\nWhat Treatments Are There for Anxiety? \\nCognitive-behavioural therapy: Many people beneﬁt from cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) which is\\nbased on the idea that people can alter their emotions and even improve their symptoms by re-evaluating\\ntheir attitudes, thought patterns and interpretations of events. An eﬀective treatment plan may also include\\nmedication, self-help groups, and relaxation techniques. Also beneﬁcial is education about the nature of\\nanxiety, its eﬀects on the body and the role it can play as part of a healthy survival instinct. With time, most\\npeople can learn to identify the early signs of a fear episode and manage their symptoms before they\\ndevelop into full-blown anxiety.\\n \\nMedications: In certain cases, medications, prescribed by a physician, may also be very helpful for anxiety.\\nSources\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Anxiety in Adults.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Tricia hates to eat in front of other people. Eric becomes sick to his stomach and throws\\nup if he has to speak aloud in class. \\n \\nLife is stressful. It is normal to have fears and worries. Being worried about things can help us prepare for potential\\ndangers. E.g. being worried about failing a test helps us study for a test. \\n \\nHowever, when those worries are so severe that they they get in the way of life, it may be an anxiety disorder.\\n \\nPeople with anxiety usually have:\\nWorries and fears (depending on the type of anxiety they have)  \\nPhysical symptoms (e.g. headaches, stomaches)\\nProblems functioning due to their severe anxiety. \\nHow Common are Anxiety Disorders?\\nAnxiety disorders are the most common mental health condition in children and adults.

The good news, is that this means parents hopefully will have more sympathy\\nand understanding on how to support their child.\\nStresses in life: Everyone has a \\'stress bucket\\' that ﬁlls up with stresses in their life. When a child has to\\nface too many stresses (e.g. parental separation; bullying; school stress; peer stress; trauma, etc.), or lacks\\nthe support of parents and family, this can add to anxiety.    \\nTypes of Anxiety Disorders\\nSeparation Anxiety Disorder.  \\n \\nRed ﬂags: Is there distress separating from parents or caregivers? If so, it may be separation anxiety disorder.  It is\\nnatural for infants and younger children to be fearful of leaving parent, as this is developmentally normal. But if an\\nolder child continues to have extreme fear, this is no longer helpful.\\n \\nSymptoms : The child may refuse to go to school; have troubles sleeping without parents; have nightmares about\\nbeing lost or kidnapped. \\n  \\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)\\n \\nRed ﬂags: Are there many worries about many diﬀerent things? Are these worries excessive, and hard to control? If\\nso, it may be generalized anxiety disorder. \\n \\nSymptoms: Multiple worries and fears about many areas. \\n \\nSocial Phobia (aka Social Anxiety Disorder) \\n \\nRed ﬂags: Is there extreme shyness? Does the shyness lead to avoidance of social situations (e.g. speaking in\\npublic, eating in front of others, asking questions in class, etc.)?  \\n \\nSymptoms: Extreme fear, distress and embarassment with social situations. Physical symptoms include blushing\\nextremely easily. \\n \\nSelective Mutism\\nRed ﬂags: Is the child able to speak in certain safe situations (e.g. at home), but unable to speak in social\\nsituations outside the home (e.g. school, doctor\\'s oﬃces, etc.)? \\n \\nSymptoms: The child\\'s alarm system is so sensitive that the child does not feel safe speaking in front of other\\npeople. Typically the child is able to speak with parents, but not to other adults. When they know they are going to\\nhave to speak, these children may blush, look down, or withdraw. When they do communicate in such situations,\\nthey may point or use other gestures, or whisper rather than talk.  Some children may \"outgrow\" the condition but\\ntheir anxiety persists as social anxiety. \\n \\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)\\nRed ﬂags: Are there obsessions (e.g. worries about being contaminated?) Are there compulsions (i.e. repetitive\\nhabits such as hand washing, cleaning)?\\n \\nSymptoms: Children and young people with OCD have frequent, distresing thoughts (\"obsessions\"), e.g. worries\\nabout being dirty or contaminated with germs. They may have a need to perform certain routines or rituals\\n(\"compulsions\") in order to feel better, e.g. washing their hands over and over again.  The obsessions and\\ncompulsions cause distress, and can take up so much time that the young person can\\'t lead a normal life.\\n \\nPanic Disorder\\n \\nRed ﬂags: Are there sudden bursts of extreme anxiety out of the blue? \\nSymptoms: Usually happens in teenagers as opposed to children. Symptoms are the body\\'s alarm (\"ﬁght / ﬂight\"\\nsystem) going oﬀ.

The symptoms are so distressing that often people try to\\navoid situations where they have had a panic attack. For example, a youth who has had a panic attack at school\\nmay start avoiding school in an attempt to avoid having panic attacks.\\n \\nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\\n \\nRed ﬂags: Has the child been through a stressful experience? Examples include life threatening experiences, but\\ncan also include repeated stressful experiences such as bullying. \\n \\nSymptoms: Jumpiness, muscle tension, being overly aware of one\\'s surroundings (hypervigilance), nightmares and\\nother sleep problems. Children and young people with PTSD sometimes also report feeling like they are \"re-living\"\\nthe traumatic experience. There can be \"ﬂashbacks\" that include vivid memories of the triggering event(s), which\\nmay involve physical, emotional or sexual abuse.  \\n \\nWhat Parents Can Do\\nDo\\'s\\nAccept that you have a sensitive child, with a sensitive alarm system that becomes easily triggered to make\\nthem feel in danger. In order to support your child, do things that will help your child feel safe. \\n \\nProvide unconditional validation. First, ensure that your child feels comfortable to express their fears,\\nworries or any other distressing feelings to you. Validate those concerns. Do not minimize them. If a child\\nfeels that they can safely come to a nurturing adult for their worries, it helps them deep down feel a bit\\nsafer about the world. \\n \\nEnsure your child has a healthy lifestyle with:\\nHealthy nutrition.\\nDaily time outside in nature, along with physical activity.\\nGood sleeping habits (8-11 hrs /day)\\nLimits on screen time, i.e. no more than 1-2 hrs/day of recreational screentime (entertainment\\nvideos, video games) for a school-aged child.  \\nThank your child for doing the best they can. If they are able to face a challenge, just say \"Thank you.\" Try\\nto avoid using praise, as many anxious kids are actually insecure with praise. Although praise is positive\\njudgment, it is still judgment. Deep down, insecure people don\\'t really want judgment, i.e. conditional\\napproval -- they want unconditional approval.\\nFor example, imagine your anxious child does something diﬃcult. It is tempting to say, \"Good job for ____!\"\\nBut for an anxious child, that can lead to pressure -- they may worry, \"What if I don\\'t do ___? Have\\nI disappointed my parent?\" Instead, just say, \"Thank you for ___. I know it wasn\\'t easy. Thank you for trying.\"\\nIf you really want to praise, use \"I statements\" like, \"I am so proud of you. I am so lucky to have a child like\\nyou, etc.\"   \\n \\nManage your own anxieties. Be a model for your child and show him how you do everyday things without\\nbeing fearful or anxious. Do seek professional help if you need help for your own anxiety. \\n \\nAvoid the avoidance. Instead of avoiding the issue that is causing fear or anxiety, reinforce exposure. If your\\nchild is afraid of spiders, you can start to read a book about spiders. If your child is afraid of speaking out in\\nfront of a group, perhaps he can talk about his favourite toy at the next family gathering. Give your child\\nopportunities to work through his fear, by reinforcing exposure and allowing small victories along the way.\\n \\nTeach your child positive \"self-talk\". Like the little engine that could, teach your child to repeat a positive\\nphrase that will help her face her fear. \"I know I can do this\" or \"I\\'m brave and I\\'m not afraid\" can help them\\nbe strong when they are feeling afraid or anxious. Or self-compassion, such as \"I am anxious. Its okay to feel\\nanxious. A lot of people feel anxious.

Distraction\\ncan work wonders when trying to deal with anxiety-provoking situations. Children can also learn how to\\nmanage anxiety by learning how to calm their breathing and how to reduce tension in their muscles;\\ntechniques for learning these are easily available through the Internet (see websites below).\\nDon'ts\\nDon't do things that would make your child feel unsafe. Children can begin to feel insecure and anxious if\\nthere is conﬂict between their parents. Diﬃcult conversations between spouses should happen when\\nchildren are not present.\\n \\nDon't get emotionally overwhelmed in front of your child, e.g. break down crying, yell or shout or scream. If\\nyou are feeling overwhelmed, do take some time to chill out and go somewhere quiet (e.g. bathroom, a\\nquick walk outside, to the corner store for milk, etc.) \\nWhere to Get Help\\nDespite your best eﬀorts to help your child cope with his fears and anxiety, there may come a time when your\\nchild's thoughts and feelings begin to overwhelm him to such an extent that you do not feel that you can handle it\\non your own.\\n \\nHere are some things you can do about it:\\nTalk to your child's teacher and other adults (coaches, instructors) who are interacting with your child.

Your physician can help you to decide if your child should see\\nsomeone, such as a child psychologist, to help him/her deal with her fears and/or anxiety.\\nHow is Anxiety Treated by Professionals?\\nWhen you see a mental health professional, they will start by doing an assessment to better understand your\\nchild's anxiety. If they recommend treatment, examples of anxiety treatments include: \\nPsychotherapies such as\\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \\nMindfulness-based therapies\\nAdvantages of psychotherapy is that it teaches practical life skills that a person will remember for a\\nvery long time. \\nDisadvantages of psychotherapy are that it can be challenging ﬁnding a provider, and it also takes a\\nlot of eﬀort for psychotherapy which can be hard if someone's anxiety is very severe.\\n \\nYoga / meditation\\nDeep breathing, mindfulness, and other features found in yoga and meditation can be calming and\\nsoothing for the nervous system, thus providing a natural antidote for anxiety. \\nAdvantages is that yoga and meditation are generally readily available. \\nDisadvantages are that for more severe issues, it may be insuﬃcient. \\n \\nMedications:\\nIf a child/youth does not respond to talking therapies such as CBT, then medications such as selective\\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can be helpful. They help regulate important brain chemicals,\\nnamely serotonin.\\nAdvantages of medications are that they can be useful if the anxiety is so severe that other\\nstrategies haven't worked. \", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Anxiety in Children and Youth_ Information for Parents and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

Classic strengths\\nassociated with ADHD include being high energy, spontaneous and creative. Unfortunately,\\nindividuals with undiagnosed ADHD can struggle in school, work or other environments that are\\nnot adapted to their unique needs. The good news is that there are many ways to support those\\nwith ADHD at school, work and relationships.\\nInattentive Ivan...\\nIvan is a 40-ish-year-old, who despite being smart and funny, struggles with work and relationships. When younger,\\ndespite teachers saying that \"Ivan has great potential,\" he found school painfully boring and was relieved when he\\nﬁnally completed high school. He thought things would get easier once he ﬁnished school, but as an adult, he faces\\nother challenges: \\nWith work, it\\'s hard to focus on the boring parts of his job. He forgets deadlines, has trouble getting tasks\\ndone. As a result, he has had troubles staying in the same ﬁeld and has been through several jobs while he\\nsees his friends around him stay in the same job, become promoted, etc.  \\nAlthough things go well at the beginning of relationships, he gets bored quickly when things are interesting\\nand exciting. As a result, he has been through numerous relationships, while he sees his friends around\\nhome keep long-term relationships and become occupied with kids and family. \\nIvan knows he has great potential but wonders why he is struggling with his work and personal life. \\nWhat is ADHD / ADD?\\nAttention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) (also known as attention deﬁcit disorder, aka ADD) are brain\\nconditions that make it hard to pay attention. Although everyone has trouble paying attention from time to time,\\nADHD/ADD is so severe that it causes problems with school, work, and relationships.\\n \\nThe main types of ADHD/ADD are:\\nADHD, combined type, where individuals have troubles with\\nInattention (so its hard to remember what people are talking about, or it is hard to get tasks done),\\nand\\nHyperactivity (where a person tends to need to move or ﬁdget a lot). Unlike children and youth, who', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Attention Deficit Disorders (AD HD) in Adults.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Strong emotions can make someone passionate and fun to be with, but unpleasant\\nemotions can cause trouble with anger and frustration.\\nEasily bored: Individuals with ADHD crave stimulation, which can be a problem when there isn\\'t enough\\nstimulation around because many situations in life (like school work and chores) aren\\'t that exciting. This\\ncontributes to other diﬃculties such as troubles ﬁnishing tasks or being organized, both of which aren\\'t\\nterribly exciting things to do...\\nTerms\\nBecause attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and attention deﬁcit disorder (ADD) are so similar, it will be\\nreferred to as ADHD to simplify things for the rest of this article. \\nStrengths of ADHD\\nIt is important to note that although many of the symptoms of ADHD can cause problems in some situations, in\\nother situations, many features of ADHD can be seen as strengths. Classic strengths of those with ADHD include:\\nFunction well with excitement: People with ADHD do well in exciting, stimulating jobs, which tend to be jobs\\nwhere you have to deal with people, as opposed to jobs where you mainly deal with paperwork. This\\nincludes the entertainment industry (like actors, comedians, performers such as dancers, musicians);\\nhospitality industry (working in restaurants, hotels, tourism); or \"911\" professions, such as police,\\nﬁreﬁghters, paramedics, or working in hospital emergency rooms (such as doctors or nurses)...\\nGreat ability to move around: People with the hyperactive type of ADHD do well in jobs where they can\\nmove around. Examples include outdoor work, trades (such as carpentry, construction, etc..), certain\\nmedical ﬁelds (e.g. nursing, surgery, etc..) On the other hand, people with ADHD do not do well in clerical\\njobs where they sit behind a desk all day...!\\nCreativity: People with ADHD tend to do well in jobs where they can be creative and use their imagination,\\nas opposed to jobs where they are doing the same boring tasks over and over again. This may explain why\\nso many artists and performers report having ADHD...\\nWondering About ADHD?\\nAre you wondering if you might have ADHD? \\nIf so, then start by seeing your family physician, who can help make sure that there aren\\'t any medical\\nproblems (such as low iron, hormone imbalances, sleep problems) that might be contributing to the troubles\\nwith attention. The doctor might suggest more specialized mental health services or professionals such as a\\npsychologist or psychiatrist. \\nAre you wondering about a loved one having ADHD, such as a spouse or partner?\\nIf so, then recommending that they seek help might be a sensitive topic. It is probably not best to start by\\ntelling them that you think they have ADHD and should see their doctor.

If\\nthey agree, then oﬀer to accompany them to their doctor\\'s appointment. \\nCoping with ADHD\\nSelf-Regulation and ADHD\\n \\nRemember the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears? She tried the bear\\'s porridge, and the porridge was either\\ntoo hot, too cold, or \"just right.\"\\n \\nOur nervous systems are the same way - they can be \"too hot\" (overstimulated), \"too cold\" (understimulated), or\\n\"just right.\"\\n \\nWe are \"too hot\" when we are overstimulated. For example, after a loud, noisy day where you\\'ve been given too\\nmuch work to do ...\\n \\nWe are \"too cold\" when we are understimulated. For example, having a very boring day or job where you had\\nnothing to do, and where you just sat around all day doing nothing.\\n \\nNeither too hot nor too cold is good. People function best when they are \"just right.\" There needs to be \"just\\nenough\" stimulation - which includes sensory stimulation (such as movement, touch, sound, smell, visual) and\\nemotional stimulation (such as getting along with others, doing interesting things in life), etc...\\n \\nSelf-regulation is about knowing what to do to make sure that you are getting \"just enough\" stimulation:\\nIf you are \"too cold\" or underwhelmed:\\nIncrease stimulation, or use soothing/calming stimulation. People with ADHD tend to need lots of\\nphysical stimulation, which is why they often do better if they have opportunities to move around,\\ntake frequent \"body breaks,\" and have things to ﬁdget with (e.g. stress balls to squeeze or chewing\\ngum to chew...)\\nIf you are \"too hot\" or overstimulated:\\nReduce the stimulation, or use soothing/calming stimulation. People with inattention can be easily\\noverstimulated visually, which explains why they often do better if they clean up their work\\nenvironments and reduce visual clutter. It also explains why people with ADHD shouldn\\'t be doing\\nimportant work sitting in front of a window because it\\'s too easy to get distracted by stuﬀ outside.\\nIf you are \"just right\"\\nKeep doing what you are doing!\\nOrganization\\nLearn how to organize in a way that works for you. People with ADHD often have trouble organizing, a fact others\\nhave pointed that out. But because they have ADHD, they may need diﬀerent organizational strategies compared\\nto other non-ADHD people. Often, visual strategies that involve writing things down on paper or making diagrams\\nor drawings are helpful. It might include things such as 1) writing a daily schedule, 2) writing a list of tasks to do\\nand crossing things oﬀ when they are done; 3) having Post-It notes to write down important things to do; 4) using\\npersonal data assistants (PDAs) such as a Blackberry or iPhone to organize things.     \\nMedications\\nWhen strategies alone are not enough, then prescription medications may be helpful such as:\\nStimulant medications such as Methylphenidate (Ritalin ® regular, Ritalin SR ®, or Concerta ® and', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Attention Deficit Disorders (AD HD) in Adults.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

But for children and youth with ADHD/ADD, the problems with\\npaying attention and getting distracted are so severe that youth can have problems with school,\\nwork and relationships.\\nWhat is Attention Deﬁcit Disorder (ADD) and Attention\\nDeﬁcit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)?\\nEveryone has trouble paying attention from time to time, especially during activities that are boring or not\\nenjoyable. But for children and youth with ADHD/ADD, the problems with paying attention and getting distracted\\nare so severe that youth can have problems with school, work and relationships.\\n \\nThere are 3 main types of ADHD:\\n \\n1. Attention-Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\\n \\nThis is the most common type, causing troubles with attention and hyperactivity. Typical symptoms of ADHD:\\nAttention deﬁcit: Being easily distracted, with trouble focusing on activities that are not very interesting or\\nboring (like schoolwork or chores). Able to focus when the activity is exciting and stimulating, like video\\ngames or sports.\\nHyperactivity: Needing to move or ﬁdget (unable to sit still in class or stay seated in class).\\nImpulsivity: Tending to do things and act before thinking.\\nDisorganization: Often losing or misplacing things, or forgetting about homework assignments.\\nChildren and youth with untreated ADHD are more likely to develop problems with school and peers. This can add\\nto later problems with mood. And mood problems may lead a teen to ‘self-medicate’ with drugs, alcohol or other\\naddictive behaviours.\\n \\n2. ADHD, Primarily Inattentive Type\\n \\nAlso known as ADD (attention deﬁcit disorder). Classic ADHD’ occurs most often in males, but females can have it\\ntoo.\\n \\nThis type of ADHD mostly involves problems with attention, without the hyperactivity seen with ADHD.

A ‘classic\\ncase’ of this type of ADHD, is an inattentive girl who daydreams and is forgetful (although boys can have\\nthis type as well). Because children with this type of ADHD are not usually disruptive in class, they don’t\\nusually come to the attention of their teachers.\\n3. ADHD, Primarily Hyperactive-Impulsive\\nChildren and youth with this type of ADHD are usually able to pay attention, but have problems with:\\nHyperactivity: Needing to move or ﬁdget (unable to sit still in class or stay seated).\\nImpulsivity: Tending to do things and act before thinking.\\nChildren and youth with ADHD may also become:\\nEasily frustrated and have mood swings. Many children and youth with ADHD report having strong\\nemotions and get frustrated easily. Strong emotions can make someone passionate and fun to be\\nwith, but feeling frustrated and angry too often can cause troubles.\\nEasily bored: Children and youth with ADHD crave stimulation (from sights, sounds, touch, movement\\nand feelings). This can be a problem, because many situations in life (like school work and chores)\\naren’t that exciting. This can make it hard for those with ADHD to ﬁnish tasks or stay organized. They\\nmay try to get others to give them the stimulation they crave, not always caring if they are getting\\npositive or negative attention. For example, a boy with ADHD may do well with structure (when he is\\nkept busy and occupied), but gets himself into trouble when he’s bored because he does things to\\nannoy his brothers and sisters.\\nThe ‘up’ side of ADHD\\nHaving ADHD can be challenging. But many of the symptoms of ADHD can also be strengths:\\nIndividuals with ADHD tend to be high energy, active and hands on, which can be helpful for professions\\nsuch as sports, outdoor jobs, trades and construction work.\\nExcitement seeking: Because people with ADHD hate to be bored, they often report seeking out stimulating\\nwork like policing or ﬁreﬁghting. In health care, they may report a preference for working in emergency\\ndepartments or as paramedics. They also tend to do better in jobs where they can work with people, instead\\nof working behind a desk doing paperwork.\\nCreativity: People with ADHD often do well in creative jobs in the arts or the entertainment industry.\\nWhat causes ADHD?\\nADHD is complex -- there isn’t just one cause. It is usually caused by a few things going on at the same time:\\nFamily history: ADHD tends to run in families. A child’s chance of having ADHD is greater if other family\\nmembers have it.\\nBrain diﬀerences: Studies show that people with ADHD have clear brain diﬀerences that are linked to the\\nsymptoms of ADHD. These include diﬀerences in:\\nBrain structure. Some areas of the brain are smaller, like the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum.\\nBrain chemistry. In children and youth with ADHD, brain chemicals like dopamine and norepinephrine\\nare less available.\\nBrain activity in some parts of the brain. Children and youth with ADHD have less activity in the\\nfrontal part of the brain.\\nIn other words: ADHD is not the child’s fault, nor is ADHD is not the parent’s fault -- parents cannot cause ADHD\\nthrough ‘bad parenting’.\\nWhat do we do if we think our child has ADHD?\\nStart by taking your child to a doctor (family doctor or pediatrician).

How can he have ADHD?\\nHaving ADHD does not mean a child is not intelligent. But troubles focusing make it harder for children and\\nyouth to succeed at school. This is why teachers often report that they are not reaching their full potential.\\nIs treatment really needed for ADHD? Can ADHD cause other problems?\\nStudies tell us that children and youth with ADHD are more likely to have problems with their moods,\\nbehaviours, and learning\\n \\nIf children with ADHD don’t get the right help, they are more likely to have depression, anxiety and\\noppositional disorder now and as they get older. Impulsivity and hyperactivity tend to get better for adults\\nwith ADHD. But without treatment, problems paying attention and getting easily distracted don’t usually get\\nbetter in adults. This can cause severe problems with work and relationships.\\nDiet and ADHD\\nFood additives: In a small number of children and youth with ADHD, parents notice that some food additives may\\nmake behaviour and concentration worse. Some researchers think that in these children and youth, food additives\\nmay get turned into brain chemicals that ‘excite’ the brain too much. If you have noticed this in your child, you can\\ntry keeping these additives out of your child’s diet for a few weeks:\\nMSG (monosodium glutamate), which is used in many restaurants and fast foods, and in some packaged\\nprocessed foods\\nArtiﬁcial food coloring, especially red dyes (avoid Jell-O™, Kool-Aid™, fruit \"drinks\" like Hi-C™)\\nArtiﬁcial sweeteners such as aspartame (e.g. Nutrasweet™) Omega 3 fatty acids:\\nSome studies suggest that some cases of ADHD may be caused by a lack of omega 3 fatty acids, such as\\nEicosapentaenoic acid (EPA):\\nSkin problems like eczema, dry skin or dandruﬀ\\nBrittle nails\\nHair\\nFeeling very thirsty, and needing to pass more urine (pee!)\\nProblems with sleep, concentration or mood\\nFuture research will tell us if Omega 3 fatty acid supplements will help some children and youth with ADHD.\\nHow is ADHD treated?\\nThe most eﬀective treatment is usually a combination of medications, school programs and therapies to work on\\nbehaviour.\\n \\nMedications\\n \\nMany parents (and children) prefer to start treatment without medications. However, one large research study\\n(Multimodal Treatment of ADHD Study) has found that treatment with medication alone was more eﬀective than\\nusing non-medication treatments (like school programs or behaviour therapy).

APD makes it more diﬃcult to hear and understand others, especially in\\nnoisy situations, even when a hearing test is normal. It can even resemble other conditions such\\nas attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and cause troubles with learning. It can lead\\nto stress and troubles functioning at school, work and home. Because it is not very well known,\\nmany people with APD struggle silently with it. The good news is that there are professionals\\nand interventions that can be done to help APD and function better.\\nIntroduction \\nSam is a 10-yo who has troubles paying attention in school. He has been diagnosed with ADHD, but treatment with\\nADHD medications hasn’t really helped. He always needs the instructions repeated in class, and has diﬃculty\\nfocusing in gym class. When alone with the teacher, he tends to understand things, but has troubles with group\\nactivities. Music class is tough because he can never understand the lyrics to songs. Since this year, he has a new\\nteacher with an accent, and has been struggling to understand him. \\nMary is in her 40’s, married with three children. She had a concussion a few years ago, and now struggles to\\nunderstand when more than one person is speaking at once. Being at home with her family has changed from\\nbeing enjoyable to exhausting and irritating. She just wishes that everyone could be more quiet. Her husband\\nseems irritable, but denies he is angry with her. Friends seem to react negatively during get-togethers. \\nWhat is APD?\\nAuditory processing disorder (APD) is a condition where someone has normal hearing (i.e. their ears work ﬁne), but\\nthe auditory system is not able to process and bring this information to the brain. As a result, the person ends up\\nhaving trouble understanding what is heard, despite having normal hearing. \\nTerms \\nAn older term for this is Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), but because all auditory processing has to\\noccur centrally (i.e. inside the brain), it is repetitive to use the term \\'central\\', and hence the simpler and shorter\\nterm \"auditory processing disorder (APD)\".\\nWhat Happens with Normal Auditory Processing vs. APD? \\nTalking to one another is a skill that most people take for granted, but it actually involves many steps which', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Auditory Processing Disorder (APD).pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 8\\ninclude:\\nStep 1: The speaker talks, which sends their spoken message through the air.  \\nStep 2: The sound goes into the ears of the listener. \\nStep 3: The message from the ears goes to the brain where the auditory information is\\nprocessed, and voilà, now the listener understands what the speaker was saying.\\nIn those with auditory processing problems however, the brain is unable to process\\nthe sounds and make sense of it. The person struggles to follow everyday speech,\\nespecially if there is background noise. It can be too rapid, too distorted, or too\\nmasked by  noise to follow. \\nBecause so much of our day-to-day communication depends on sound information\\n(spoken language), auditory processing problems can cause signiﬁcant problems at\\nschool, work, home and in relationships.\\nNormal Development of Auditory Processing\\nAuditory processing is a normal ability that develops in childhood. In some children, it develops faster than others.\\nHowever, by age 7, most have similar abilities. Some (C)APD skills continue to develop until late adolescence. \\nWhat Causes APD?\\nMany factors can aﬀect the brain’s ability to process auditory information such as: \\nGenetic factors, i.e. some people inherit auditory processing problems from their parents. 1.\\nAcquired, i.e. it is caused by problems at birth, untreated ear infections that aﬀect hearing, or brain injury2.\\n(e.g. head injury or concussion). \\nHow Common is APD?\\nIn children/youth ', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Auditory Processing Disorder (APD).pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Some people who are on the spectrum may be very high\\nfunctioning in some areas (e.g. be very good at school at some subject, sport, skill or hobby),\\nyet at the same time, have problems seeing things from other\\'s perspective, that thus can lead\\nto severe problems interacting socially with other people, leading to problems at school, work\\nand relationships. Previously known as Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD NOS) or\\nAsperger’s Syndrome.\\n\"Thomas likes trains...\"\\nThomas is a 10-year-old boy who has always been really interested in trains. He knows so much about trains that\\nhe can go on and on with his vast, encyclopedic knowledge. If you wanted to know the train schedule at the local\\ntrain station, he could tell you. Schoolwork has never been a concern and he has always done well in school with\\nlittle eﬀort.\\n \\nUnfortunately, when it comes to anything involving people, he has a lot more diﬃculties. He just can\\'t seem to\\nrelate to others, and has no friends. He doesn\\'t seem to get social cues. He\\'ll talk endlessly about trains without\\nrealizing that others are getting bored, and conversations are a monologue not a true dialogue. He tends to come\\noﬀ as being selﬁsh and self-centered, because he just can\\'t seem to see things from other people\\'s point of view.\\nAs he gets older, it\\'s becoming apparent that he really is quite diﬀerent from his peers. One day after school,\\nfrustrated he was excluded by other peers at lunch again, he says, ‘Sometimes I just wish I could ﬁt in like the\\nothers...\\'\\nWhat are Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)?\\nThe Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a group of neurologic conditions that aﬀects a person\\'s ability to\\ncommunicate, understand, play and relate to others. Individuals with ASDs often also demonstrate unusual\\nbehaviours such as repetitive movements (e.g., hand ﬂapping) or they may be unusually preoccupied with a\\nspeciﬁc interest (e.g. trains, dinosaurs, doors, collectibles such as Pokemon, etc.)\\nASD is a \"spectrum\" as these conditions occur along a continuum. \\nPast terms to describe these conditions included: \\nPervasive developmental disorder not otherwise speciﬁed (PDDNOS) \\nAsperger Syndrome', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Children and Youth_ Information for Families.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Page 2 / 10\\nNow we understand that all of these diﬀerent conditions fall under one umbrella term: Autism Spectrum Disorder\\n(ASD).\\nCommon Features of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\\nIndividuals with autism spectrum disorder have the following things common, which include:\\n1. Social communication and interaction:\\nDiﬃculties with communication including non-verbal. When we communicate, we use both verbal language\\n(the words we use to express ourselves) and non-verbal language (‘how’ we say things, including our body\\nlanguage, tone of voice, facial expressions and gestures). People with autism spectrum disorder can have\\ndiﬃculties with non-verbal communication. For example, this may mean that they have trouble maintaining\\nnormal eye contact or understanding the gestures of other people. They may have trouble understanding\\nsocial cues. As such, they may ﬁnd it diﬃcult to adjust their behaviours to various diﬀerent social contexts.\\n \\nDiﬃculties relating to people. People who have autism spectrum disorder may also ﬁnd that they have\\ndiﬃculties relating to people. This may be related to underlying diﬃculties with ‘theory of mind', which is\\nproblems with empathy or seeing things from other's perspectives. In order to get by in the world, it helps to\\nbe able to guess or ﬁgure out how someone else is thinking or feeling. For example, if we know that a friend\\nhas had a bad day, then we can usually guess that our friend might be feeling sad or upset. However,\\nindividuals with ASD often have diﬃculty seeing things from someone else's perspective, which makes it\\nmuch more diﬃcult for them to deal with other people. This is why children with ASD often may appear non-\\nempathetic or uncaring. With eﬀective intervention, children with ASD may start to learn how to be more\\nempathetic in situations, but it may not be a skill that comes automatically.\\n2. Restricted or repetitive behaviours, interests or activities, including:\\nUnusual play with toys and objects.  A child on the autism spectrum may play with toys, but often will\\nplay with them diﬀerently than other children do. For example, a child playing with trains may line them up\\nover and over again or be obsessed with parts of a toy or repeatedly take apart and put a toy back together.\\nRigid routines and/or preoccupation with routines or rituals . Many children on the autism spectrum\\nmay have routines that they persist in doing over and over again and they may get extremely upset if they\\nare kept from doing them. This includes placing things in a certain way or order. Because these symptoms\\nare very similar to those seen in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), these children may receive an\\nadditional diagnosis of OCD by health professionals, prior to their being recognized as having an underlying\\nautism spectrum disorder.\\n \\nDiﬃculty with transitions such as changes in routine or one's surroundings. Possibly due to sensory\\nprocessing issues, since changes in routine/environment represent changes in sensory input, children with\\nautism spectrum disorders may be sensitive to changes or transitions in their environment. For example,\\nparents often report that the child has trouble shifting from one activity to another. Even the slightest\\nchanges in routine or schedules can cause problems. Parents ﬁnd they need to give advance notice about\\nactivities or changes. They generally do better when their routine and environment is consistent and stable.\\nChanges in caregivers or teachers may be particularly stressful for some children.\\n \\nSensory processing disorder , which is a problem processing sensory input such as sound, touch and\\nmovement. For this reason, these children may be hypersensitive and become distressed or try to avoid\\nsensory input such as sound, touch or movement. E.g. becoming upset with loud noises, become upset\\nwhen touched, have troubles with tags on clothing or food textures. Others may be under sensitive, and in\\nfact try to seek out sensory input such as sound, touch or movement. E.g. screaming, touching everything,\\nor spinning. In many individuals, sensory issues can be severe and if not dealt with, can cause even more\\nimpairment than having ASD itself.\\nAssociated symptoms and conditions generally seen in Autism Spectrum Disorders  (but which can also be seen in\\nother conditions) include:\\nDiﬃculties with distractibility and inattention.   Individuals with ASD are often distractible and\\ninattentive, and it is important to explore if there are any factors contributing to this. For example, perhaps\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Children and Youth_ Information for Families.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 3 / 10\\nthe child is actually distracted from being overwhelmed from too much sound (such as the hum of the\\nﬂuorescent lights), or from simply being in a large, noisy classroom. In such a case, reducing the sensory\\noverload would thus help with the concentration.\\nIn some cases, individuals with ASD may also receive a diagnosis of Attention Deﬁcit Disorder (ADD) or\\nAttention Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and may beneﬁt from standard ADHD treatment (Holtmann,\\n2005).\\n \\nProblems with moods such as anger or anxiety . When we get overwhelmed, we can get angry, anxious\\nor upset. Because of their other challenges, children with autism spectrum disorder may be at an increased\\nrisk of getting overwhelmed and upset. One way to help them is to ﬁgure out what exactly is stressing the\\nchild, so that a plan can be put together to deal with each of the stresses. For example, typical stresses may\\ninclude  school (peers, teachers, school work) or home (dealing with parents, siblings).\\nThere are some things that individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder may not all have. For example, some\\nindividuals may have delays in normal spoken language, while others may have normal spoken language but still\\nhave problems expressing their thoughts/feelings or diﬃculties with non-verbal communication. A large number of\\nindividuals with autism spectrum disorder may have other problems like intellectual disabilities or mental\\nretardation, while others may actually have above average intelligence. \\nStrengths of ASD \\nDespite the diﬃculties that they may have, individuals with ASD also have many strengths which may include:\\nBeing very good at following rules and laws , as well as trying to understand things according to rules\\nand laws (Baron-Cohen, 2003).\\nBeing object rather than people focused , which helps some individuals with ASD do very well in ﬁelds\\nsuch as science, engineering, computers. In addition, many individuals with ASD have interests across other\\nﬁelds that include arts, music, drama, and social sciences, to name just a few.\\nBeing able to focus their attention for long periods of time , even on tasks which others may ﬁnd\\nboring or mundane.\\nBeing able to stay objective , and not be as aﬀected by ‘peer pressure\\' or others opinions (e.g. children\\non the autism spectrum are far less inﬂuenced by peers when it comes to clothing trends or pressure to try\\ndrugs)\\nBeing visual . Many may have exceptional (even \"photographic\") visual memory (i.e. memory for things\\nthat they have seen). These strong visualization skills (the ability to think in pictures) may help in\\nengineering, design and other visual ﬁelds.\\nBeing auditory and verbal. Rather than being visual however, many with ASD may have exceptional\\nauditory memory (i.e. memory for things that they have heard.) Strong verbal skills in fact, can help in\\nfuture professionals such as being a writer, editor, tour guide, or lecturer...\\nStrong \"analytical\" or logical reasoning skills , which may help with accounting, engineering, and\\ncomputers...\\nShow great depth of knowledge in areas of interest , which can help them become experts in their\\nﬁelds of interest.\\nHaving a super work ethic , as they tend to be punctual, reliable, dependable and very accurate!\\nTreatment and Interventions are Necessary\\nIndividuals with ASDs have a unique way of perceiving the world which can be an asset. However, they are\\nvulnerable to stresses at home, school and other environments. They are easily overwhelmed by sensory triggers\\n(e.g. sound, light, noise, smell, etc.) which can trigger behavioral or emotional problems. They may have social\\ndiﬃculties which make it diﬀerent to get along with others at home, school and other places.  As children with ASD\\ngrow older, many of them may develop depression and anxiety.\\n \\nThus, intervention is essential to help not just the child with an autism spectrum disorder, but all those who\\ninteract with the child, including family, relatives, teachers and classmates.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Children and Youth_ Information for Families.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Page 4 / 10\\nEvidence-Based Treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\\nIt can be overwhelming to hear about all the numerous treatments recommended for autism spectrum disorders.\\nMany well advertised and promoted treatments do not have research support so parents should be careful to\\nevaluate treatment options. \\n \\nWhen considering any treatment, here is a list of useful questions that parents might consider asking (Freeman,\\n1997):  \\nIs there any harm from this treatment?\\nIs the treatment developmentally appropriate for the child?\\nIf the treatment does not work, how will it aﬀect my child and family?\\nHas the treatment been validated scientiﬁcally\\nHow will the treatment be integrated into my child's current program, and life routines? (Parents should be\\nwary of a program that ignores other aspects of the child's life and education.)\\nMain Interventions for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) \\nThe main types of interventions for children/youth with autism spectrum disorders are the following:  \\n \\n1. Social Skills and Life Skills Interventions\\n \\nThese are interventions to improve social skills and help the child relate and get along better with other people\\n(Perry and Condillac, 2003).\\n \\nFor example:\\nIdentifying thoughts or feelings: individuals with ASD often have a lot of diﬃculty knowing what they are\\nthinking or feeling.\\nExpressing thoughts or feelings: its one thing to know what you're thinking or feeling, but its equally\\nimportant to know how to properly express those thoughts or feelings - including when its appropriate and\\nwhen its not!\\nTeaching the child empathy, which is the ability to see things from another person's perspective.\\nHow to identify and respond to other people's emotions\\nConversational skills such as listening to others, taking turns in conversation, etc. \\nRemember Spock, or Lieutenant Data on Star Trek? They had trouble understanding human emotions and why\\nhumans behave the way they do. Children and youth with ASD are similar; normal rules of human relationships and\\nfeelings which come automatically to neurotypical children may need to be explicitly taught to a child with ASD.\\n \\n2. Language and Communication-Based Interventions\\n \\nThese are interventions to help the child with diﬃculties with language and communication (Perry and Condillac,\\n2003).  \\n \\nAlthough children with ASD may have normal verbal language, they have trouble communicating with others due\\nto diﬃculty with their non-verbal language. This includes reading social cues, tone of voice, knowing how to take\\nturns in conversation, knowing how to show a genuine interest in others, etc.\\n \\nMany of these naturally overlap with social skills interventions; after all, you need to be able to communicate with\\nothers in order to get along with them.\\n \\n3. Sensory and Motor Interventions\\n \\nSensory processing (aka. Sensory integration) is a person's ability to take in, process and make sense of\\ninformation from our senses (such as sound, touch, taste, and movement).\\n \", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Children and Youth_ Information for Families.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 5 / 10\\nMany individuals with autism have sensory processing problems such as:\\n \\nHypersensitivity to sound, e.g. becoming easily upset or overwhelmed with what appears to others to be\\nnormal levels of sound.\\nHypersensitivity to touch, e.g. having trouble with food textures or tags on clothing.\\nAlthough there are a variety of programs and interventions that claim to help with sensory issues, experts do not\\nyet fully agree about whether these therapies truly work or not. Although many parents report that sensory\\ninterventions may be helpful, there remains a lack of adequate scientiﬁc evidence.\\n \\nFor this reason, sensory interventions they should be only be used along with a) proven therapies, (b) with careful\\nevaluation, and (c) if they do not interfere with proven therapies. They should not be used as a sole\\nintervention for autism spectrum disorders.\\n \\n4. Intervention for Challenging Behaviour / Behavioural Management\\n \\nIndividuals with ASDs often have diﬃcult behaviours, such as aggression, self-injury behaviours, or other disruptive\\nand inappropriate behaviours. Research supports the use of positive behavioural strategies as the ﬁrst treatment\\nstrategy for problem behaviour (Perry and Condillac, 2003).\\n \\nIt is recommended to:\\nUse behavioural principles to manage behaviour. E.g. ﬁgure out what purpose a behaviour is trying to serve,\\nand try to oﬀer more adaptive ways to achieve the same purpose.\\n5. Biomedical interventions such as Medications\\n \\nWhen behavioural strategies are not enough, then other strategies such as medications may be used for speciﬁc\\nspeciﬁc behaviours or conditions (such as obsessive compulsive disorder, or attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity\\ndisorder) or speciﬁc symptoms (such as impulsivity, insomnia).\\n \\n6.     Psychotherapy\\n \\nOne type of \"talk therapy\", known as cognitive-behaviour therapy may be helpful (Attwood, 2006). These programs\\nhelp children cope by looking at their thoughts, feelings and behaviours.\\n \\n7.     Treating any other associated conditions\\n \\nIf the child has any other conditions, it is important that there are strategies and treatments for them as well.\\nOther conditions that may commonly be seen in children/youth with ASD include:\\nAttention-Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): a condition where a child has troubles with inattention, and\\nmay also have troubles with hyperactivity and impulsivity.\\nMood problems such as anxiety and depression, which may occur when individuals become overwhelmed by\\nthe stresses in their life. Typical stresses in children with ASD include relationships with teachers, family and\\npeers. Identifying stresses and coming up with ways to cope with them is one way to deal with mood\\nproblems.\\nThe following school interventions are recommended:\\nThe student with ASD should be identiﬁed as a special needs student (through a process known as an\\nIdentiﬁcation, Placement and Review Committee, aka IPRC) so an individual education plan (IEP) can be put\\nin place.\\nAn IEP has speciﬁc accommodations and modiﬁcations to the student\\'s educational program to help that\\nstudent succeed.\\nResources available may include access to educational assistants (EA), Occupational Therapists (OT),\\nphysiotherapy (PT), behavioral specialists, autism specialists and assistive technology such as laptops or FM\\n(hearing) systems.\\nStudents with ASD are usually placed in the regular classroom (unless there are learning diﬃculties),\\noccasionally with EA or resource support. In general, easing the workload in high school by substituting one', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Children and Youth_ Information for Families.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 6 / 10\\nor more courses with resource periods is recommended.\\nIf a child is unable to cope in the regular school system, some school boards have special classes for\\nstudents with ASD.\\nPsychoeducational Assessment:  if not already done, it can be very helpful for a child with ASD to be\\nseen by a school psychologist for a psychoeducational assessment which is a series of very detailed tests to\\nassess the child\\'s learning strengths and diﬃculties, such as whether or not there are any learning\\ndisorders.\\nSpeciﬁc School Accommodations and Modiﬁcations\\nThe following table lists some general recommendations for students with ASD, but note that every child is unique\\nso accommodations need to be tailored for the individual child:\\n \\nResistance to change\\n \\nThe need to have the same routine every day, and the tendency to become distressed if routines are changed\\neven in the slightest way.\\nAs much as possible, ensure a consistent, predictable environment with routines.\\nProvide a written schedule for the day\\'s events; for students, it is enough to have it on the board; others\\nmay need it written on a sheet that they can keep at their desk.\\nAnticipate future events that will cause changes in routines; e.g., the teacher can tell the child that s/he will\\nprobably be away several times during the year and that there will be a supply teacher.\\nGive transition warnings; i.e., instead of simply switching from one activity to another, tell the child ahead of\\ntime that there will be a change.\\nGive choice whenever possible; e.g., \"You can ﬁnish up now, or you can have another minute...\"\\nWith major changes like going to a new school, the child should be orientated ahead of time, by visiting the\\nnew school (several times if necessary), walking the route if appropriate, meeting teachers ahead of time,\\netc.\\n \\nSocial skills diﬃculties\\n \\nUnlike other students, the ASD student does not automatically learn the subtle social rules required to get along\\nwith other children, and thus may appear self-centered; talking \"at\" rather than \"with\" others; saying inappropriate\\nthings even if they are true; e.g., calling someone ‘fat\\', saying their clothes are ugly, etc.\\nExplicitly teach social skills to the student, either one-on-one (ideally in a subtle way so the child doesn\\'t\\nfeel singled out), or as part of the teaching to the entire class.\\nIn direct interactions with the student be prepared to gently cue the child to more positive behaviors.\\nCreate and rehearse \"social scripts\" (dialogues for diﬀerent social situations) and \"social stories\" (short\\nstories that explicitly explain what to do in a social situation and why).\\nPraise and positively reinforce the child for showing positive social skills, even if they seem obvious.\\nKeep an eye on the child\\'s interactions with peers, and intervene if the child\\'s behaviors are causing other\\npeers to take notice and start teasing - kids with ASD are at high risk of social ostracism, teasing and\\nbullying from others. Improve the child\\'s self-esteem and at the same time help the child to connect with\\npeers by letting the ASD student use their academic strengths to help others; e.g., a student who is a good\\nreader could be given an opportunity to read to peers with diﬃculties in reading. Find one or two empathetic\\npeers who can be a guide and protector for the student.\\nNo matter how frustrated you may be with the student, avoid any teasing, ridicule or shaming.\\nNon-verbal communication diﬃculties\\n \\nMuch of our communication is non-verbal, relying on eye contact, gestures, or body language.\\nPoor eye contact. Many students with ASD ﬁnd eye contact overwhelming, which leads them to avoid eye\\ncontact. Thus, do not force the child to look at you, and do not punish or blame a child who doesn\\'t give you\\ndirect eye contact.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Children and Youth_ Information for Families.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 7 / 10\\nDo not rely exclusively on body language.  Body language is communication by using body movements\\nand gestures. People with ASD have a hard time reading body language, thus if you are getting bored with\\nsomeone with ASD about their favorite hobby, instead giving vague non-verbals like looking at your watch\\nor looking impatient, you may have to simply tell him/her, \"Thanks for telling me about that. I have to go\\nnow.\" \\nPractise non-verbal cues , e.g., watch TV with the sound oﬀ or observe a social interaction from a distance\\nin the playground and ask the child to describe the action and how people might be feeling.\\nDiﬃculty interpreting and modulating volume and tone of voice. The student may not be able to tell\\nthe diﬀerence between your \"happy\" voice and \"angry\" voice so use words to explain your emotion; e.g., if\\nyou are frustrated, say you are frustrated and don\\'t just rely on your tone or volume to show how you\\'re\\nfeeling.\\nSimilarly, a student with ASD may smile or laugh when anxious or look bored when happy so be careful how you\\ninterpret their moods. Teaching them to practice appropriate facial expressions in a mirror may help.\\n \\nTendency to be concrete and take things literally\\n \\nThis tendency also may cause student to misinterpret sarcasm or humor.\\nLimit  (not eliminate) the use of metaphors (or explain them the ﬁrst time you use them); e.g., instead of:\\n\"I\\'m worried about how you\\'re doing in math-you\\'ve got to pull up your socks!\" say \"I\\'m worried about how\\nyou\\'re doing in math-you need to ask questions if you don\\'t understand, and make sure you regularly do\\nyour homework.\"\\nBe aware of how much non-literal or metaphorical communication you are using; e.g., your tone of voice,\\nsarcasm, expressions, rhetorical questions, etc. Clarify when necessary.\\nNote that many children with ASD enjoy humor and expressions of speech so rather than avoiding them\\ncompletely explain them the ﬁrst time you use them.\\nSince people with ÅSD tend to have \"concrete\" thinking, simplify abstract concepts. Presenting visual\\nimages that represent abstract concepts may help visual learners. For example, Temple Grandin, a well-\\nknown author, speaker, and individual with an autism spectrum condition, found the image of a dove, peace\\npipe, or the signing of a peace agreement helpful for understanding the concept of peace.\\nComprehension tends to be weak\\nDo not assume that a child who reads ﬂuently or parrots back what you say perfectly comprehends at the\\nsame level. Ask follow up questions to be sure they\\'ve understood.\\nConcentration diﬃculties\\n \\nThe student with ASD may have diﬃculties with distractibility, inattentiveness, and organization skills and also\\nhave an oﬃcial diagnosis of Attention-Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\\nAll the usual ADD/ADHD accommodations that help a child pay attention or focus better may be helpful for\\nexample, seating the child near the front of the classroom.\\nLimit visual distractions where the child sits.\\nIf the student is taking a long time to answer a question, try not to interrupt as this may derail the child\\'s\\nconcentration and s/he will have to start over again to get his/her train of thought back.\\nIf a child is under stimulated, then oﬀer healthy ways of stimulation (e.g., if he/she ﬁdgets, allow the child to\\ngo for a walk, sit on an exercise ball, etc.).\\nExecutive function diﬃculties\\n \\nIndividuals with ASD may have trouble with ‘executive function\\', which is the ability to prioritize, plan, organize and\\nmanage time and space. Thus, speciﬁc strategies may be needed for all these.\\nBreak homework tasks into small steps, setting deadlines for the completion of each.\\nOlder students may ﬁnd it helpful to keep all their subject notes in one binder; younger students may\\nbeneﬁt from colour-coded binders or duotangs matched with textbooks marked with matching dots.\\nConstant communication to and from school is essential to keeping student organized.\\nAdults may have to take the role of helping the child with \"executive functions\" until the child is able to do', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Children and Youth_ Information for Families.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

For example, you\\nmight let the child ask only three questions daily about the topic, and then only a certain time.\\nAt the same time, the interest might be used to connect the child with peers with similar interests, or to help\\nteach academics. For example, a child interested in trains may be motivated to solve math questions\\ninvolving train scenarios. A story or article about trains could be used for a reading assignment. Use the\\nspecial interest as a bridge to other interests, e.g., the study of trains might lead to comparisons to other\\nmodes of transportation.\\nMotor diﬃculties\\n \\nMotor diﬃculties includes ﬁne motor problems (such as diﬃculties with handwriting, and being able to copy and\\nunderstand what they are copying), as well as gross motor problems (clumsiness that makes it diﬃcult for the child\\nto play team sports in the gym or school yard).\\nSome school boards provide Occupational Therapy (OT) support to ASD students for ﬁne motor, and\\nsometimes gross motor diﬃculties\\nGross motor: make accommodations for gym class so that the child isn't pushed into competitive situations\\nwith other peers. Do not have students choose teams because the child with ASD will inevitably be the last\\nchild picked.\\nFine motor: typical accommodations include:\\nSpecial pen/pencil grip to make it easier to hold pens/pencils\\nAllowing the child to write on graph paper which makes it easier for him/her to plan visual-spatially\\nFor older students, allowing the use of keyboard for taking notes or written assignments or tests\\nProviding photocopies of teacher's notes and more time to copy oﬀ the board.\\nSensory processing issues\\n \\nMost students with ASD have sensory issues, and may thus be overwhelmed by seemingly normal levels of sensory\\nstimuli such as sound, or touch.\\nBe aware that the child may become easily over stimulated by noises, lights, strong tastes or textures, and\\nthat if s/he can't recognize that s/he is over stimulated, then teachers will need to recognize the cues and\\nteach the child to also recognize them.\\nFor touch hypersensitivity, make accommodations so the child is less likely to be touched unexpectedly; for\\nexample:\\nAllow the child to have more personal space in ‘Circle Time'\\nAllow the child to be at the front, or the back of a line up, but try to avoid the middle of a line up due to\\njostling\\nAssign the student a locker at the end of a hallway so they only have to deal with one student beside them.\\nUse ﬁrm touch rather than light touch\\nTell the student if you are about to touch him/her\\nFor troubles with auditory processing:\\nSome kids may beneﬁt from FM systems (the child wears a headset that broadcasts the teacher's voice\\ndirectly into the child's ears, thus reducing the amount of other noises that could interfere)\\nSeat the child near the teacher, yet away from distractions (e.g., away from the hallway door)\\nSpeak slowly, in small phrases\\nTeach to the type of learner, e.g., for visual learners use visual cues, or written instructions to reinforce\\nverbal messages .\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Children and Youth_ Information for Families.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",

A person\\nmay have one or more of the following: troubles with appetite; general disinterest in eating;\\nsensory sensitivities that make it hard to eat; past troubling experiences that result in feeding\\ndiﬃculties. As a result, the person struggles to eat enough calories as well as enough nutrients,\\nwhich can cause problems with poor energy, focus, concentration, stamina and growth. Unlike\\nconditions such as anorexia nervosa, individuals with ARFID do not have body image\\npreoccupation, nor a desire to lose weight. In fact, sometimes they may worry about being “too\\nthin” or “unhealthy”. Treatment of ARFID is about making a customized plan based on the\\nperson’s concerns and symptoms. Are you worried about ARFID in yourself or a loved one? Start\\nby seeing a family physician or paediatrician.\\nJ’s Story, Part 1\\nJ. is a 10-yo male previously well. Unfortunately, this has been a stressful year with multiple stresses such as a) his\\nparents separated; b) he has been bullied at school; c) he had a medical issue that required prescription\\nmedications that led to side eﬀects of nausea. Although the medication has since ﬁnished, J. still says he feels\\nnausea that prevents him from eating enough. As a result, he has lost a lot of weight. \\nD’s Story, Part 1\\nD. is a 5-yo with troubles feeding since an early age. Now, she is having troubles transitioning to textured solid\\nfoods; and she avoids new foods as a result. She has less than 10 foods that she will eat and is beginning to restrict\\nher intake more with time. Her weight has dropped so much that her parents are starting to get worried.\\nWho Gets It?\\nARFID can happen in people of all ages, such as children, youth and adults.\\nNote: ARFID is not due to “bad parenting”.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)_ Information for Families.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 6\\nWhat Causes ARFID? What Does ARFID Look Like?\\nARFID can appear in diﬀerent ways such as:\\nType 1: Person experiences stressful life events, which then lead to troubles eating and weight loss.1.\\nType 2: Person has had troubles with appetite regulation such as knowing when they are hungry and need2.\\nto eat, or feeling full too easily (i.e. early satiety), which can lead to weight loss.\\nType 3: Child has sensory processing problems, which causes limited intake.3.\\nDiagnosis\\nDSM-5 Criteria\\nARFID is an eating or feeding disturbance that manifests as a chronic failure to satisfy energy or nutritional needs\\nassociated with at least one of the following:\\nA signiﬁcant deﬁcit in nutrition.\\nSigniﬁcant loss of weight, not achieving expected weight gain, or the absence of normal physical\\ndevelopment.\\nDisruption in psychosocial functioning.\\nReliance on enteral feeding (e.g., feeding tube) or oral nutritional supplements.\\nARFID is not accompanied by a distortion of one’s weight or body shape and is not concurrent with symptoms of\\nanorexia or bulimia.\\nExclusion criteria for ARFID\\nARFID is not due to\\nUnavailability of food such as from poverty or famine,\\nCulturally sanctioned food observance or practice\\nA medical condition,\\nA diﬀerent psychiatric disorder.\\nCould the Eating Problems Be Due to Something Else? \\nThere are other conditions where people may have troubles with eating such as:\\nAnorexia / Bulimia\\nPatients with anorexia/bulimia may have less intake due to their anorexia/bulimia.\\nUnlike anorexia/bulimia, patients with ARFID do not obsess about body image, and are not fearful of\\nweight gain.\\nEmetophobia (Fear of vomiting)\\nIndividual is worried about vomiting and as a result, restricts intake to avoid the potential for\\nvomiting\\n“Picky eating”\\nARFID is more than simply a child with “picky eating”\\nAlthough the term “picky eating” is often used, note that there is no standardized deﬁnition, although\\ntypically it refers to a child who\\nConsumes an inadequate variety of foods\\nHas limited variety of foods eaten\\nRejects foods that may either be familiar or unfamiliar\\nRejects foods of a particular texture, consistency, color, or smell\\nHas unusual eating behaviors\\nPicky eating behaviours generally peak between age 2-6, and improves gradually over time', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)_ Information for Families.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Page 3 / 6\\nChildren with picky eating behaviors should have normal growth and development\\nARFID Can Occur With Other Issues \\nProblems eating can occur with other conditions as well such as: \\n• Depression: Are there problems with depressed mood?\\n• Anxiety: Are there problems with severe anxiety, to the point that it gets in the way of life?\\n• Obsessive compulsive\\ndisorder (OCD)Are there problems with distressing fears and worries that come back over and over\\nagain? (e.g. fears of being contaminated)\\nAre there rituals or habits that must be done otherwise the person feels anxious? (e.g.\\ntidying, counting, cleaning, hand washing)\\n• Autism spectrum disorder\\n(ASD)Are there problems with connecting and relating to other people? Does the person see\\nonly their perspective, and is unable to see other's? Are there narrow, focused interests\\nin just one area?\\nIf so, it would be helpful to explore these issues further, and see if perhaps addressing those issues might be\\nhelpful. See a health care provider (e.g. primary care provider, or mental health professional) to explore further. \\nSelf-Help: Strategies for Parents and Caregivers\\nTreatment of ARFID involves a customized plan, based on that speciﬁc individual. There is no “one size ﬁts all”\\napproach.\\nTips for Mealtimes\\nWe don’t usually think of eating as a ‘skill’, but it is. Eating problems may begin because of physical diﬀerences\\nthat make learning to manage and enjoy food more diﬃcult. Worse, if a child has had stressful experiences eating,\\nthis may contribute to make eating diﬃcult.\\nThe good news is that there are many things parents can do to help their child learn eating skills, while also\\nkeeping the environment relaxed.\\nDo’s\\nDo stick to a routine for meals and snacks. This will encourage hunger in your child. Stay with this schedule,\\neven if your child does not eat a meal.\\nDo have your child sit at the table or in a highchair for all meals and snacks.\\nDo eat with your child. If you’re not ready for your own meal, have a small snack like carrot sticks.\\nDo notice positive mealtime behaviours, like:\\nComing to the table;\\nSitting at the table;\\nTaking tastes of food.\\nDo keep portions small. Always oﬀer a small serving of a food your child likes as you introduce new foods on\\nher plate.\\nDo schedule a time for drinks. Oﬀer liquids during snack time or mealtime.\\nDo keep meals simple. Too many choices can be confusing for your child.\\nDo limit mealtime to 10-30 minutes. If your child is not cooperating at the table, thank him for coming to the\\ntable, and take the meal away in a gentle, calm manner without being angry or blaming. .\\nDon’ts\\nDon’t express any feelings of frustration or disappointment during a meal or snack if your child doesn’t eat.\\nThis can add to your child’s stress; and your child is already having enough stress.\\nFood Chaining\\nFood chaining is where you start with the foods that your child is able to eat, and based on these foods, one slowly\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)_ Information for Families.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Praise, such as “You’re such a good child” can be too much for\\nsome kids. Although praise is positive, its still a judgment. The\\nsensitive kids may feel that they are “bad” if they aren’t successful.\\n• Examples of positive behaviours include:\\n    ⚬ Sitting calmly in the highchair\\n    ⚬ Holding a spoon\\n    ⚬ Picking up a piece of food.\\n• Just describe what you see in a positive tone (with a smile!)\\n    ⚬ \"I see you’re holding your spoon already!\"\\n    ⚬ \"You’ve got a piece of apple.\"\\n    ⚬ \"I like it when you’re sitting in your chair.\" • Don’t focus on negative behaviours --\\nbecause all children want attention, they may\\ninadvertently do negative behaviours just to get\\nmore attention from parents, even if it is\\nnegative.\\n• Do ignore negative food refusal behaviours.\\n• Has your child done something negative such as said \"yuck!\" or spat\\nor threw their food?\\n    ⚬ Don’t ‘accidentally’ reward him by expressing your frustration.\\n    ⚬ Any expression of emotion from you (worry, irritation, disgust)\\nmay cause your child to repeat these unwanted behaviours.\\n    ⚬ Try to stay calm and \\n        ▪ Keep your face calm;\\n        ▪ Act as if the behaviour is of no interest to you;\\n        ▪ Continue your meal;\\n        ▪ Keep chatting with another family member.• Don’t pay attention to food refusal\\nbehaviours.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)_ Information for Families.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 5 / 6\\n• Do stay quiet when your child is not eating. It’s best not to say\\nanything at all, because your voice carries emotion, and your words\\nshow interest.\\n• While your child sits staring at her plate, try to busy yourself with\\nsomething else(such as eating your meal), but be ready to show\\ninterest in eating related behaviours.\\n• Example:\\n    ⚬ If your child picks up a spoon, you could say, \"We’re using our\\nspoons and forks\".• Don’t coax or pressure or threaten your child\\nto eat -- this just gives attention to not eating.\\n• Do keep calm and carry on, even if your child gags or coughs.

Now that we are returning back to school under COVID, it can be even more challenging.\\nThe good news is that there are many things that you can do to support your children and youth\\nwith the return to school.\\nIntroduction\\nThe COVID pandemic has been particularly diﬃcult for students and families, as most students have been out of\\nschool since lockdown started in spring 2020, but school boards across the country are now planning for a return to\\nschool for fall 2020. On one hand, most families (and many students) likely welcome the return back to school. On\\nthe other hand, there are many concerns about returning to school under COVID. For some students, the new\\nnormal of learning from home has actually been less stressful than attending school.\\nDeciding on Whether to Return Your Child to School\\nMany school boards are oﬀering parents the option between 1) returning students physically back to school\\n(ranging from part-time to full-time) versus 2) keeping your child at home and continuing with virtual schooling, vs.\\n3) a combination of physical return and virtual schooling.\\nAre you uncertain about which choice to make? The CDC has a Back to School Decision Making Tool to help you\\nweigh the risks and beneﬁts of each option.\\nReasons to attend school include:\\nYour child learns best when physically at school;\\nYour child beneﬁts from seeing peer and other school activities such as physical activity;\\nChild care so that parents can work; access to meal programs and other services.\\nReasons to avoid physical return to school:\\nYour child (or someone living at home such as a parent or sibling) has an underlying condition (or age) that\\nincreases the risk for severe illness from COVID.\\nThe level of community spread is high in your area (which increases the risk of COVID).\\nYour child has issues such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), learning diﬀerences, ADHD, troubles with\\nbullying, gender diﬀerences, or other issues that make return to school particularly challenging.\\nReasons to consider virtual schooling from home:\\nThere is someone who can supervise your child at home;', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Back to School under COVID_ Tips for Parents and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 7\\nYour child has access to reliable technology (such as internet) for your child’s virtual learning;\\nYour child’s virtual learning option does give opportunities for real-time interactions with the teachers (e.g.,\\nhave live instruction).\\nYour child’s maturity and learning style are suﬃcient for virtual learning.\\nReturning to School: What Families Can Do\\nHere are some tips that may help make an easier transition back to school under COVID.\\nDuring the summer prior to school\\nContinue to encourage your child’s social connections with peers, which will help your child feel more connected to\\ntheir peers by the time school starts.\\nIdeally this involves face-to-face connections outside, as per COVID physical distancing. Next best would be\\nvirtual connections where you can see the other person’s face in real time, such as video chat (e.g.\\nFacetime, Skype).\\nThe least preferred would be email, texting or Instagram, as you cannot see the other person’s face for non-\\nverbal messages.\\nAlternatively an old fashioned written letter or card is another way to connect.\\nContinue educational-related and learning routines\\nContinue educational related routines like going to the library, reading time, or educational apps or\\nwebsites. It’s hard for children to read or use an educational app when they are distracted by recreational\\nscreen time; parents may need to use parental control settings and active limit setting for this to happen.\\nA few weeks before school starts, gradually get back into school\\nyear structure and routines\\nBring up the topic that summer is coming to an end, and that school will be restarting.\\nMention the negatives. Parent: “On one hand, COVID lockdown has not been easy.”\\nMention the positives. “On the other hand, I’m so grateful that we’ve had a chance to spend a lot more time\\ntogether.”\\nAsk about routines to continue. “What new COVID routines would people like to continue during the school year?, e.g.\\nregular family walks after dinner; family dance night, etc.\\nLet your children know that there will be a return to school.\\nExplore any concerns, such as emotional,\\npractical or others.Parent: “School is starting up again in a few weeks… How do you feel about\\nthat?”\\nInvite self-reﬂection. Parent:”For you, what were the good parts about being at home instead of\\ngoing to school? What were the parts you didn’t like?”\\nIs your child feeling worried, anxious or stressed?\\nReﬂect back what you are hearing from your child. Parent: “You’re feeling a bit worried….”\\nExplore in more detail. Try to listen without interrupting. Parent: “Tell me more…”\\nThank your child for taking the courage and trouble to\\ncommunicate with you.Parent: “Thank you for letting me know.” “I’m glad you’re\\nletting me know.”\\nExploring your child’s main concern or worry.

Parent: “I’m here for you. Let me give you a hug..”\\nEspecially with older children and teens, ask what they\\nwant. Oﬀer “support” not “solutions”.Parent: “How can I support you? Want me to just listen? Or\\ndo you want my advice?”\\nTalk about routines.\\nDuring a normal summer, most families have less expectations and this has been ampliﬁed during\\nCOVID -- thus, many kids (and adults) are using more screen time, going to bed late and sleeping in\\nlate.\\n“Let’s talk about what the routine is going to be when the school year starts up… To help make the\\nchange easier, we’re going to gradually get back into things, as opposed to all at once.”\\nExamples of routines to focus on include:\\nBedtimes / Wakeup times: Set a bedtime (and/or wake up time) and move it closer to what it should\\nbe for the school year.\\nReduce excess recreational screen time: High yield ways to cut back include:\\nSetting a screen curfew, i.e. setting a “downtime” after which point there are no screens, e.g.\\n8-9 PM for school aged kids ideally, or 8:30-9:30 PM for high school aged kids. (Yes, many\\nteenagers left to their devices are using devices until midnight or later, but unfortunately, this\\nis very disruptive for their sleep.\\nOne way to set screen time limits is to use the “Parental Controls Settings” available on most\\ndevices. This way, you can set the device to turn oﬀ automatically by a certain time, or times\\non certain apps, etc. In cases where you have an oppositional child or teen, this makes it much\\neasier to set limits than having to physically wrestle the device away.\\nHelp them with getting used to some of the new COVID routines, such as\\nWearing a mask in school. Some children will be able to do this more easily, others may have a\\nharder time.\\nConsider the following strategies\\nStep-by-step exposure and desensitization strategies\\nAre you buying a mask? Consider giving your child some of the newer child-friendly designs to choose\\nfrom; or decorate a pre-made mask.\\nAre you making a mask? Allow your child to choose material.\\nCreating an exposure hierarchy\\nFrom least scary to most scary, it might be\\nSeeing others wear a mask.\\nSeeing a mask.\\nTouching a mask.\\nPutting on a mask for short periods of time.\\nPutting on a mask for longer periods of time.\\nTeach distraction and calming strategies\\nDistraction strategies include distracting the child with music, videos, video games to help\\npass the time while wearing a mask.\\nCalming strategies include deep breathing, going outside, going for a walk, etc.\\nConsider motivating kids to get used to wearing a mask by pairing it with something\\nthey enjoy. E.g. Allow video game time (within your limits) while wearing their mask.\\nAre there still struggles with mask wearing, despite your best eﬀorts?

It turns out that a special type of sound known\\nas binaural beats may be able to help your brain.\\nWhat are Binaural Beats?\\nBinaural beats is when your brain hears two diﬀerent tones in each ear, that are a diﬀerent frequency. For\\nexample, if you are hearing a sound that is at a frequency of 132 Hz in the left ear, and a tone that is 121 Hz in the\\nright ear, then your brain will fall into synchrony with the diﬀerence, which is 132 Hz minus 121 Hz = 11 Hz. Your\\nbrain will hear a tone at 11 Hz (in addition to the two tones in each ear). It is an “auditory illusion”.\\nBinaural beats require that: \\nThe two tones have frequencies less than 1000 Hz\\nThe diﬀerence between the tones can’t be more than 30 Hz\\nThe tones must be listened to separately through each ear.\\nWhat Might It Help With?\\nSome studies suggest that binaural beats might be helpful for:\\nSleep (Abeln, 2014)\\nAnxiety (Le Scouarnec, 2001)\\nChronic pain (Zampi, 2016)\\nTinnitus (David, 2010)', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Binaural Beats.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

High periods or \\'manic episodes\\' are marked by abnormally high\\nor irritable moods, along with increased energy and decreased need for sleep. During high\\nperiods, people may do risky or impulsive things that cause problems. Low periods are marked\\nby low energy and depreassed moods. The good news is that there are many things that can be\\ndone to improve the mood swings and get oﬀ the rollar coaster of moods.\\nWhat Is Bipolar Disorder?\\nAll of us have changes and swings in our mood which are normal. There are times when our mood is up, and we\\nhave more energy and excitement about things. There are other times when our moods are down, and we have\\nless energy.\\n \\nHowever, people with bipolar disorder  have periods of extreme mood change that  cause serious problems in their\\nlives.\\n \\nIn the classic form of bipolar, people have episodes of depression and of mania, when their mood, energy, thinking\\nand behaviour gets stuck for a period of time at a very  low or a  very high level. Hence the term, \"bipolar\", which\\nrefers to the two (\"bi-\") diﬀerent poles of mood (\"-polar\").\\n \\nHigh energy periods, or manic episodes / mania  consists of periods with symptoms such as:\\nPersistent period of high energy, lasting days to weeks, during which time a person has a decreased need\\nfor sleep (e.g. only needs a few hours of sleep, or even none at all, yet still has lots of energy the next day).\\nExtremes of mood, which may be excessively \"high\" (overly good, euphoric mood) or extreme\\nirritability .[this would be mixed not manic]\\nRacing thoughts, i.e. thought ﬂow increased speed\\nPressured speech, i.e. talking very fast\\nDistractibility, can\\'t concentrate well\\nIncreased self-esteem, which can be the point where one has grandiose, unrealistic ideas about oneself\\nIncreased activity\\nPoor judgment, decision-making and impulsive behaviours such as making large purchases, gambling or', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Bipolar Disorder (Children and Youth).pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 8\\nother risky behaviours such as doing drugs or increased sex drive.\\nLack of insight that anything is wrong, such that the person may deny that there is a problem. But in a\\nclassic manic episode, it is obvious to friends and family that something is wrong as this (behaviour)\\nrepresents a change for this person. * not sure if we want behaviour persay, but maybe need to be more\\nspeciﬁc than \"this\".*\\nWhile some individuals with bipolar disorder  experience full-blown manic episodes, others also experience a mild\\nto moderate level of mania, known as \"hypomania\". Hypomania is milder than mania, but it is a major change in\\nfunctioning for the individual and it may lead into full-blown mania, or major depression.\\n \\nWhat goes up must come down, which is why periods of high energy (manic episodes) are typically followed by low\\nenergy periods.\\n \\nLow energy episo des or depressive episodes  may occur to the extreme such that the person may have:\\nExtremely low energy for days or weeks, with increased need for sleep\\nExtremely low, depressed mood that is stuck and not reactive to what is happening around the person\\nFeelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness\\nLoss of interest or pleasure in activities\\nDue to low mood, the person may have thoughts that life isn\\'t worth living, even to the point of thinking\\nabout making attempts to end one\\'s life.\\nMood episodes may also get so extreme that the person loses touch with reality, and may have symptoms of\\npsychosis such as:\\nHallucinations, which includes hearing or seeing things which aren\\'t actually there. For example, hearing\\nvoices or seeing people.\\nDelusions, which are false beliefs with no basis in reality. For example, in a manic phase, one might believe\\nthat they can ﬂy, or that they are a famous celebrity. On the other hand in a depressive phase, one might\\nfeel extreme irrational guilt.\\nThe Positive Side of Bipolar \\nWhy do some people have bipolar? Studies show that the same genes that contribute to bipolar disorder may very\\nwell be the same genes linked to intelligence and creativity (Smith, 2015). Throughout human history, there are\\nnumerous notable examples of famous people that have had bipolar disorder. Bipolar traits and bipolar disorder\\nmay simply be the genetic price for intelligence and creativity.\\nHow Common is Bipolar Disorder?\\nWith children/youth:\\nBipolar occurs in 1% of children/youth at any given time (Costello et al., Lewinsohn et al).\\nWith adults\\nBipolar I or II occurs in up to 4% of adults (Kessler, 2005).\\nWhen Does Bipolar Disorder Start?\\nBipolar usually starts in late teens or adulthood. In fact, about 50-66% of adults with bipolar report that their\\nsymptoms started before age 19 (Chang, 2007).\\nIf You Suspect Bipolar... \\nIf you suspect that your child may have bipolar disorder, take your child to be seen by your primary care provider\\n(such as a family doctor  or paediatrician ) to make sure there aren\\'t any medical problems (such as hormone', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Bipolar Disorder (Children and Youth).pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Many individuals present ﬁrst with major\\ndepressive episodes when younger and do not go onto develop manic episodes until older.\\nBipolar II, consisting of hypomanic episodes and major depressive episodes.\\nCyclothymia, consisting of hypomanic episodes with depressive episodes (but not severe enough to be\\nmajor depressive episodes per se).\\nBipolar Not Otherwise Speciﬁed (NOS), which is used to describe individuals with mood swings that cause\\nproblems, but which do not ﬁt into any of the other above categories. In the past, many children/youth used\\nto be diagnosed with BIpolar NOS, but it turns out for many of them, the diagnosis of disruptive mood\\ndysregulation disorder (DMDD) may be more appropriate.\\nIn addition, other terms used include:\\nRapid-cycling: when a person has at least 4 episodes per year. This type is seen about 5-15% of patients.\\nMixed state: when a person has both manic and depressive symptoms occurring at the same time.\\nDiagnosis of Bipolar Disorder\\nPsychologists and psychiatrists are the main professionals qualiﬁed to make a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.\\nDuring the assessment, the doctor asks the patient (and family members) about symptoms, the developmental\\nand school history and the family history in order to make a determination about diagnosis and recommendations.\\n \\nGetting a proper diagnosis is important. Because bipolar disorder is generally treated with medications, giving\\nsomeone a diagnosis will generally lead to medication treatment. Misdiagnosing someone with bipolar disorder\\nwhen they don't have it can lead to unnecessary medication use along with medication side eﬀects. At the same\\ntime, not diagnosing someone who truly has it means that that person will miss out on potentially life-changing\\ntreatment.\\n \\nAt this time, there is not yet any blood test, brain scan or other diagnostic test that can help with the diagnosis of\\nbipolar disorder. \\nOther Conditions May Contribute to, or Look Like Bipolar\\nThere are other conditions that can also contribute to mood problems (e.g. mood swings, anger or rage). If any of\\nthese are present, they can be addressed as well:\\nMedical conditions\\nThyroid problems\\nSeizure disorders\\nTourette's syndrome or tic disorders\\nDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD)\\nPeople who have severely unstable moods on a daily basis, as opposed to being episodic (as in\\nbipolar).  \\nAttention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\\nADHD is deﬁned as severe problems with inattention and distractibility, and individuals with ADHD\\nmay have constant problems with anger and low frustration tolerance. \", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Bipolar Disorder (Children and Youth).pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Unfortunately, all too many\\nchildren/youth (and adults) use electronic devices in the evening, which tricks the brain into thinking\\nit is daytime. \\nSleep is very important in bipolar. A study showed the eﬀectiveness of \"dark therapy\", i.e. exposing\\npatients to darkness from 6 PM to 8 AM for a few days helped improve manic symptoms such that\\npatients had less need for medication and were discharged earlier from hospital (Barbini, 2005).\\nSleep tips include: \\n\\u2028Limit the electronics, and come up with a good sleep routine to ensure sleep.\\u2028\\u2028\\nKeep the same times on weekends as well as weekdays.\\nDon\\'t stay up late or sleep in later on weekends, because this can be very disruptive for\\nthe internal clock. It is like having ‘mini\\' jet lag every weekend.\\nRegular physical activity, ideally outdoors. \\nStudies show the eﬀectiveness of being active, particularly outside. \\nHave a healthy diet. \\nHave regular meals and snacks.

Even milder stimulants such\\nas coﬀee or prescription medications for ADHD (such as methylphenidate) need to be monitored\\nclosely by a physician.\\nBe wary of taking antidepressants. \\nFor people with bipolar, the use of antidepressant medication carries a risk of causing manic\\nepisodes, so close monitoring is required by a physician.

Parents often try to support their kids by giving them advice or telling them what to do. But most kids will\\ntell us that what they want ﬁrst and foremost, is for parents to listen, to understand and accept, and not jump in\\nwith advice. They want \"connection before correction\". \\nHere are some top ways to help your child develop emotional regulation skills: \\nHelp your child express pleasant feelings by labelling and validating those feelings. When your\\nchild is happy, validate the happy feelings, for example:  \\nChild/youth: \"Look, I got to the next level in the game!\" (looking excited)\\nParent: \"It looks like that makes you so happy... I\\'m glad to see you\\'re so happy...\"\\nIt is possible that you may not agree with why your child is so happy (e.g. video game binge or doing drugs),\\nbut at least you can start with connecting by agreeing that they want to be happy.\\nValidate your child\\'s feelings and emotions when your child is upset. When your child is upset, help\\nyour child label and express their feelings. This is not always easy, particularly if your child is angry or upset\\nat you. \\nChild: \"I hate you! You\\'re the worst parent ever!\"\\nParent (to child): \"Wow! You\\'re so angry right now... You\\'re angry at me because I said no... I know, its not\\neasy when I say no...\"\\nYou may not agree with the reason why your child is angry, but helping your child use his/her words is one\\nof the ﬁrst steps to helping your child regulate the anger...\\n \\nTell your child that you are concerned about him or her, and be available and support your\\nloved one with bipolar disorder. Ask your child how s/he would like to be supported.\\nParent: \"I\\'m concerned about you and want to be there for you. How can I support you? How do you want\\nme to be help?\"  \\nDon\\'t give advice if your child isn\\'t ready to receive it. Advice is better accepted when the other\\nperson gives you permission to receive it. Simply lecturing or telling the other person what to do may not\\nwork as well, particularly with independence-seeking teens, because this may lead him/her to withdraw.\\nYou might say: \"I\\'m worried about you... Can I give you some advice?\"\\nIf it is a serious situation where one\\'s physical safety is at risk, you may have to intervene.\\nBut if it is not, you may have to just back oﬀ, and focus on building up the trust until your child/youth is\\nready for your advice. You might then say: \"That\\'s okay. I respect that you want to be independent. I\\'m\\nhere, whenever you\\'re ready...\"\\nLater on, continue building up your relationship with your child by ensuring that you spend 1:1 time together\\nwith your child. \\n \\nHelp the person get connected with professional help. Talk to your child about seeing a doctor, and\\ntake your child to see a doctor, for example: \\nParent: \"Its been awhile since you\\'ve seen the doctor for a checkup, so I think it would be a good idea for\\nyou to go.\"\\nIf your child/youth has a strong need for independence, then perhaps give your child/youth some limited', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Bipolar Disorder (Children and Youth).pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

Do you want\\nthe appointment in the morning or the afternoon?\"\\nTreatments for Bipolar: Medications\\nStudies show that individuals with bipolar disorder have brain diﬀerences compared to other people. In other\\nwords, bipolar disorder is not your child\\'s fault, nor is it due to choice or bad behavior, just like the way in which\\nother brain conditions such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis are also similarly not the person\\'s fault.\\nMedications\\nBecause bipolar disorder has such a strong biological basis, medications are often necessary in the treatment of\\n(true) bipolar disorder.\\nCommon medications used in the treatment of bipolar disorder include:\\nLithium\\nDivalproex (trade name Epival)\\nLamotrigine (trade name Lamictal)\\nOlanzapine (trade name Zyprexa)\\nQuetiapine (trade name Seroquel)\\nRisperidone (trade name Risperdal)\\nAripiprazole (trade name Abilify)\\nFor more information about medications, speak to your doctor.\\nTreatments for Bipolar: Counselling/Therapy \\nMany people ﬁnd it helpful to see a counselor / therapist, in order to help with their bipolar and other issues. \\nFor more information about counselling/therapy. \\nFor More Information\\nWebsites\\nBipolar Disorder, National Institutes of Mental Health, retrieved Feb 22, 2008 from\\nhttp://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/bipolar-disorder/complete-publication.shtml . \\nBooks\\nFor parents\\nSurvival Strategies for Parenting the Child and Teen With Bipolar Disorder, by George T.

These high\\nperiods are often followed by periods of severe low mood and depression, even to the point where he has thoughts\\nof suicide. What\\'s going on here? Is it normal mood swings, or could it be something else?\\nWhat Is Bipolar Disorder?\\nEveryone gets mood swings whereby sometimes our mood and energy is up, and where sometimes our mood and\\nenergy is down. But if you have mood swings so severe that it causes problems in your life, then it may be bipolar\\ndisorder.\\n \\nIn classic bipolar disorder, people have periods of (‘episodes\\') of:\\nExtremely low moods such as depression\\nExtremely high energy periods, with either high, manic or euphoric moods, or irritable moods\\nHence the term, \"bipolar\", which refers to the two diﬀerent poles of mood that a person can have.\\n  \\nHigh energy periods, or manic episodes / mania  consists of periods with symptoms such as:\\nPersistent period of high energy, lasting days to weeks, during which time a person has a decreased need\\nfor sleep (e.g. only needs a few hours of sleep, or even none at all, yet still has lots of energy the next day).\\nExtremes of mood, which may be excessively \"high\" (overly good, euphoric mood) and at times extreme\\nirritability.[this would be mixed not manic]\\nRacing thoughts, i.e. thought ﬂow increased speed', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Bipolar Disorder in Adults.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

But in a\\nclassic manic episode, it is obvious to friends and family that something is wrong as the patient\\'s thoughts\\nand behaviours represent a change for this person.\\nWhile some individuals with bipolar disorder experience full-blown manic episodes, others also experience a mild to\\nmoderate level of mania, known as \"hypomania\". Hypomania is milder than mania, but it is a major change in\\nfunctioning for the individual and it may lead into full-blown mania, or major depression.\\n \\nWhat goes up must come down, which is why periods of high energy (manic episodes) are typically followed by low\\nenergy periods.\\n \\nLow energy episodes  or depressive episodes may occur to the extreme such that the person may have:\\nExtremely low energy for days or weeks, with increased need for sleep\\nExtremely low, depressed mood that is stuck and not reactive to what is happening around the person\\nFeelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness\\nLoss of interest or pleasure in activities\\nDue to low mood, the person may have thoughts that life isn\\'t worth living, even to the point of thinking\\nabout making attempts to end one\\'s life.\\nMood episodes may also get so extreme that the person loses touch with reality, and may have symptoms of\\npsychosis such as:\\nHallucinations, which includes hearing or seeing things which aren\\'t actually there. For example, hearing\\nvoices or seeing people.\\nDelusions, which are false beliefs with no basis in reality. For example, in a manic phase, one might believe\\nthat they can ﬂy, or that they are a famous celebrity. On the other hand in a depressive phase, one might\\nfeel extreme irrational guilt.\\nTypes of Bipolar Disorder\\nAccording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), a manual used by mental health\\nprofessionals to diagnose mental health conditions, the main types of bipolar disorder recognized in adults are:\\nBipolar I, classically consisting of manic (major high) and depressive episodes (major low). In fact, many\\nindividuals present ﬁrst with major depressive episodes when younger and do not go onto develop manic\\nepisodes until older.\\nBipolar II, consisting of hypomanic (mild highs) episodes and major depressive episodes (major low).  \\nCyclothymia, consisting of hypomanic episodes (mild high) with minor depressive episodes (minor low).\\nBipolar Not Otherwise Speciﬁed (NOS), which is used to describe individuals with mood swings that cause\\nproblems, but which do not ﬁt into any of the other above categories.\\nIn addition, other terms used include:\\nRapid-cycling: when a person has at least 4 episodes per year. This type is seen about 5-15% of patients.\\nMixed state: when a person has both manic and depressive symptoms occurring at the same time\\nHow Common is Bipolar Disorder?\\nIt is generally believed that bipolar I or II occurs in up to 4% of adults (Kessler, 2005), and it is usually believed to\\nstart in late teens or adulthood (Kessler, 2005).', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Bipolar Disorder in Adults.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

If you ﬁnd yourself answering YES to more than a few of\\nthese questions, consider seeing a doctor.\\nDo you often get high energy periods?\\nDuring these high energy periods, do you ﬁnd that you have less need for sleep (e.g. sleeping very little or\\nnot at all)?\\nDuring these times, do you ﬁnd yourself being much more talkative or speaking much faster than usual?\\nDuring these times, are much more active and do more things than usual?\\nDo you often get times when you have felt both high (elated) and low (depressed) at the same time?\\nDuring these periods, do you ﬁnd your self-conﬁdence being greatly improved?\\nIf you suspect that you have bipolar disorder, then see your doctor.\\nDiagnosis of Bipolar Disorder\\nPsychologists and psychiatrists are the main professionals qualiﬁed to make a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. During\\nan assessment, the doctor asks the patient (and family members) about symptoms, the developmental and school\\nhistory and the family history in order to make a determination about diagnosis and recommendations. At this\\ntime, there is not yet any blood test, brain scan or other diagnostic test that can help with the diagnosis of bipolar\\ndisorder. \\nTreatment of Bipolar Disorder\\nBipolar disorder is usually treated with a combination of several components, which includes:\\nPhysical treatments including medications\\nCounselling / psychotherapy (talk therapy)\\nEducation about the condition and coping strategies\\nPhysical Treatments for Bipolar Disorder\\nMedications\\n \\nBecause bipolar disorder is due to changes in brain chemistry, medications are generally necessary in the\\ntreatment. \\n \\nCommon medications used in the treatment of bipolar disorder include:\\nLithium\\nDivalproex (trade name Epival)\\nLamotrigine (trade name Lamictal)\\nOlanzapine (trade name Zyprexa)\\nSeroquel (trade name Quetiapine)\\nRisperidone (trade name Risperdal)\\nTalk to a medical doctor (such as a family physician, or psychiatrist) for more information about medication\\ntreatment.\\n \\nLife Style Strategies\\nKeep regular, daily routines , which will help you set your body's internal clock and thus help with bipolar\\ndisorder (Frank, 2007).

These include:\\nMaking ﬁnal arrangements for one\\'s aﬀairs\\nGiving away one\\'s possessions\\nFeeling hopeless about the future.\\nIf you are concerned about suicide, then get help as soon as possible, which may even include calling 911 in\\na crisis. People who consider suicide often consider it as a way to stop being a burden to others - tell your\\nloved one that suicide would be a tremendous burden and not a good way to ﬁnd relief.\\nIf your friend is prone to manic episodes, have an ‘advance directive\\' in case your friend becomes manic.\\nPeople who are manic may engage in impulsive activities such as spending sprees, long trips, or other\\nbehaviours. You should talk to your family member about holding onto credit cards, banking privileges and\\ncar keys. Talk openly to your family member about when hospitalization may be necessary.\\nDon\\'t take rejection personally. If your family member becomes unwell with a mood episode, and stops\\naccepting your help, remember this is not a rejection of you - it is the illness.\\nAs a caregiver, don\\'t neglect your own health! Remember that you are not alone, and consider joining a\\nsupport group for networking and mutual support.\\nIn Case of Crisis\\nIf your loved one is having either a manic episode or a severe depression, then see a doctor as soon as possible.

Humans are a social species, and indeed, humans judge each other based on appearance and\\ngrooming. It makes sense that one would want to keep one’s appearance within a certain range, in order to ﬁt in\\nwith others. \\n \\nHowever, in some people, these concerns are so severe that it becomes a disorder. \\n \\nBody dysmorphic disorder (BDD), also known as dysmorphophobia (fear of something being wrong with one’s\\nbody), is a condition where individuals are obsessed with perceived ﬂaws in their appearance to the point that it\\ncauses problems in their life (APA, 2013). \\n \\nTypical symptoms are:\\nThinking and worrying constantly about the defects or ﬂaws that they think they have, or comparing\\nthemselves with others. \\nWorries that other people notice, judge or talk about their perceived defect (when in all likelihood, people\\nare not noticing anything at all). \\nBehaviours such as\\nAttempting to conceal their perceived defects with make-up, clothing.\\nExcessive grooming to try to remove perceived imperfections such as combing one\\'s hair repeatedly.\\nPicking their skin. \\nAsking for constant reassurance from others.;\\nOther symptoms may include:\\nWorries about being photographed or ﬁlmed.\\nBeing critical about not only their own appearance, but that of others. \\nPeople with BDD may have concerns about any part of the body. However, most concerns are about the face (e.g.\\nnose being too big, or eyes being too small), hair or skin. Males may be prone to have worries about their muscular\\nbuild (i.e. worries about being small, weak and not muscular enough). \\nFriends and relatives would say the concerns are imaginary because there is no obvious defect. Even if there is an\\nimperfection, most others would regard these as \"normal\" imperfections and the worries to be excessive and\\nunreasonable.\\n \\nThese behaviors and thoughts are distressing, not pleasurable and are hard to control/resist.\\nNegative Impact of Having BDD \\nBDD can cause a signiﬁcant negative impact on a person’s life. As a result of their BDD, they may: \\nReduce or avoid close relationships. \\nReduce or avoid school, work or social activities. \\nIn some cases, people can even become housebound. \\nPeople with BDD may also be at risk of other conditions and problems such as:\\nDepression, social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), substance use problems. The severe\\nstress caused by having BDD can even lead to thoughts that life is no longer worth living.\\nHow Common is BDD? \\nIn the USA, about 2.2% of men, and 2.5% of women suﬀer from BDD.

Even if the treatment is performed,\\nit typically does not help people feel better -- it does not deal with the underlying worries.\\nWhat Causes Body Dysmorphic Disorder? \\nLike most many conditions, body dysmorphic disorder is likely due to a combination of factors such as: \\nGenetics and family history.\\nThe person has experienced stressful life experiences. Most people with BDD report they have had\\nsigniﬁcant stressful and/or traumatic life experiences. \\nSocietal pressures from society and mass media to look a certain way, with its emphasis on “beauty” and\\n“perfection”. \\nWhat Happens in Body Dysmorphic Disorder?\\n \\nThe person with BDD notices a detail about their appearance… \\nIn person with BDD, the brain hyperfocuses on details (as opposed to the ‘big picture’) (Feusner,\\n2010; Toh, 2017; Jeﬀeries, 2012).  \\n \\n \\nThe brain perceives that there is something wrong, and as a result, the person’s alarm system  (“ﬁght\\nor ﬂight”) activates, leading to feelings of anxiety and distress.   \\n\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Body Dysmorphic Disorder.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Vision Exercises to Promote Peripheral Vision \\n \\nGood peripheral vision is felt to be helpful in many endeavours (such as sports, reading and driving). Interestingly\\nenough, vision exercises have been proposed for help with calming the nervous system (Bowan, 2008).  \\n \\nThere appears to be promising anecdotal evidence that peripheral vision exercises may be a helpful strategy to\\nhelp with body dysmorphic disorder (Launay, 2020), though note that more research is required in this area. \\n \\nConsider doing the following: \\nDo try to deliberately focus on the big picture, and be aware of your surroundings, as opposed to\\nhyperfocusing with central vision on details, such as individual ﬂaws.\\nAre you sitting or standing up?\\nHold your hands at diﬀerent points at the limits of your peripheral vision\\nMove your ﬁngers, while looking at a point in the middle distance and being aware of the\\nmovements of your hands.\\nAre you walking outside? Be aware of your surroundings on your left and right side.\\nAre you on the train or bus? It may be easier to do this on a train or bus, because normally you can’t see\\nmuch forward anyways. Notice the landscape streaming by on both sides of your vision.\\nAre you outside in nature? Try to enjoy the beautiful landscape. Look at a large painting or poster on your\\nwall. Put a nature screensaver / background on your computer screen.\\nAre you using a computer? Try to remember the 20/20/20 rule -- every 20 minutes, look at least 20 feet\\naway, for at least seconds, at something panoramic rather than narrow.\\nAfter a short while of doing any of the above exercises, you will hopefully feel more relaxed and calm (i.e.\\ndemonstrating your parasympathetic system has been activated).\\n \\n2.

You may hear them\\ntalking about their concerns about their body, and most likely, you will have tried to reassure them that everything\\nis alright. Yet despite their reassurance, they continue to be obsessed and distressed with perceived\\nimperfections. \\n \\nRecommendations\\nTry to see things from their perspective, and understand how stressful it must be to feel that there is\\nsomething seriously wrong with your body. \\nValidate how stressed they are to be worried that something is wrong. “Thank you for letting me know about\\nyour worries. I can see this is really tough for you.”\\nAsk how you might support them: “How can I support you?”\\nStay calm. No matter how frustrated you get, it really doesn’t help to get angry or upset at them. It is not\\ntheir fault -- they have these worries because of the illness, which itself is due to something with the way\\ntheir brain is wired.   \\nAsk them if they might be open to seeing a health care professional to help them deal with the incredible\\nstress that they are having. You do not need to mention that they have BDD. \\nWhen to See a Professional\\nHave you (or your loved one) tried various strategies but is still struggling with body dysmorphic disorder? \\nIf so, then see a health professional, such as your primary care provider. Your provider can ensure that there\\naren’t other conditions that might be contributing. \\nYour family physician can recommend services and supports that might be helpful in your area, such as a\\nmental health clinic, or a psychologist, social worker, or other health professional. \\nHow is Body Dysmorphic Disorder Treated?\\nCognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)\\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of talking therapy given by a trained professional, such as a\\npsychotherapist, psychologist or psychiatrist.\\n \\nBody dysmorphic disorder tricks people into having negative thoughts (e.g. \"I\\'m so ugly\") and behaviours (e.g.\\navoiding going out).

What can be done about it?\\nPracticing positive,\\n“coping thoughts” i) Monitoring and learning to be aware of one\\'s \\'automatic\\' thoughts.\\nE.g. \"Aha! I\\'m getting worried about my nose again! That\\'s the BDD tricking me into having\\nthose thoughts, its not me. I\\'m not going to let the BDD get in the way of my life.\"\\nii) Evaluating both the usefulness and validity of thoughts, by asking questions such as:\\nE.g. \"Is this a helpful thought?\"\\nE.g. \"What\\'s the evidence to support this thought?\"\\niii) Challenging unhelpful thoughts and replacing them with more helpful thoughts, by asking\\noneself questions such as:\\nE.g. \"What is a more valid or realistic thought?\"\\nE.g. \"What is a more helpful or useful thought to have?\"\\n \\nFor example, a person with BDD might change his/her negative thoughts (e.g. \"I\\'m so ugly\")\\ninto more realistic thoughts (e.g. \"Sure, my nose isn\\'t perfect, but hey, I\\'m deﬁnitely not\\nugly! Even if I was, my friends and family would still love me.\")\\nPracticing positive,\\n“coping behavioursc) Learning helpful behaviours to overcome the BDD:\\ni) Exposure: BDD typically tricks people into avoiding social situations, or stressful situations\\nsuch as mirrors. Exposure is about helping the person to gradually face more and more of\\nthese situations, at a comfortable, gradual step-by-step fashion.\\nii) Response prevention: BDD typically tricks people into having compulsive behaviours such\\nas skin picking, comparing oneself to others, looking in the mirror. Response prevention is\\nabout preventing these behaviours from happening, once again, in a gradual, step-by-step\\nfashion.\\n \\nAdvantages of psychotherapy: CBT teaches skills that can be long lasting. Compared to medications, CBT does not\\nhave the same risk of physical side eﬀects.\\n \\nDisadvantage of psychotherapy: CBT requires the person to have enough capacity and ability to do CBT. When\\none’s symptoms are too severe, CBT may simply not be possible.  \\nStill struggling despite psychotherapy? \\nIf so, then medications may be helpful such as:\\nSpeciﬁc serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which work by increasing the function of serotonin in the\\nbrain. Treatments usually need to be given for long periods (i.e. 12-16 weeks).\\nExamples of SSRIs include Fluoxetine (Prozac), Citalopram (Celexa), Sertraline (Zoloft), Fluvoxamine\\n(Luvox), Escitalopram (Cipralex), Paroxetine (Paxil). Other similar medications include Venlafaxine (Eﬀexor).\\nAdvantages of medications: When one is feeling overwhelmed, a person may not have the ability to see a\\ntherapist, whereas it may be possible to take a medication to help with the symptoms. After the medications have\\nhelped, this can then make it possible for the person to see a therapist, do visual exercises, etc. \\n \\nDisadvantages / disadvantages of medications: Medications can sometimes cause side eﬀects. On the other hand,\\nthis is why medications are monitored by a prescribing physician, in order to manage any side eﬀects that might\\narise, e.g. reducing the dosage of the medication, stopping the medication, or changing a medication.   \\nFor More Information \\nMusicians who have written about speciﬁc exercises to calm the autonomic nervous system via parasympathetic\\nexercises.\\nFlorence Launay, a vocal coach who writes about the link between tunnel vision and BDD, recommends\\nperipheral vision exercises for both music performance and in body dysmorphic disorder.

For people with borderline personality traits, these fears become overwhelming\\nand extreme.\\nIntroduction\\nAll humans are social, and one of our deepest needs is to attach, or feel connected to others. In fact, we can’t\\nsurvive without others. When we’re young, our most important attachments are to parents and adult caregivers. As\\nwe get older, our attachments change to include friends and peers. In adulthood, it changes to focus on romantic\\npartners.\\nBecause one of our deepest needs is to attach, it is natural then, that one of our deepest fears is lack of\\nattachment, or rejection, or abandonment.\\nPositives of being sensitive\\nBeing sensitive may mean they can be very thoughtful and conscientious of other's feelings, which can help\\nother's feel empathized, validated and good about themselves.\\nWhen in a good place, they can be extremely fun, exciting and passionate to be with.\\nIt is normal for everyone to be sensitive from time to time.\\nHowever, in some people, their emotional sensitivity can be so extreme that it may be part of 'borderline\\npersonality disorder'.\\nCould My Loved One Have Borderline Personality Disorder?\\nIndividuals who have symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder tend to: \\nBe very afraid of being rejected or abandoned. Because of this, they can become very clingy in\\nrelationships. They may need a lot of reassurance, which can be hard for others to understand. \\nHave trouble regulating their emotions(for example, controlling intense emotions and anger). It’s natural to\\ncare about our relationships. It’s important for us to get upset if we have stress in our relationships because\\nthis reminds us to work out the problem. For those with borderline personality traits, their extreme emotions\\ncause problems. \\nHave impulsive and harmful behaviour. Those with borderline personality traits may turn to negative\\nbehaviours (like self-harm or self-medicating with drugs and alcohol) to control their intense emotions. But\\nin the long run, these negative behaviours end up causing more problems.\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Borderline Personality Disorder in Adults.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Many sensitive people have experienced situations that they have been overwhelming or\\nstressful for them, contributing to their concerns of rejection or abandonment. This includes obviously\\nstressful situations such as trauma or abuse. It can also include stresses such as parental separation or\\ndivorce. It can be bullying from peers. It may also simply be that the person's need for emotional validation /\\nacceptance, was higher than that which the environment was able to provide. Some children simply have\\nhigh emotional / attachment needs, and their well-meaning environment / parent(s) may simply have been\\nunable to meet that need.\\nOther Conditions\\nPeople with Borderline Personality Disorder often have other conditions, like: \\nAnxiety disorders; \\nSubstance abuse; \\nMood disorders (like depression); \\nEating disorders (usually binge eating or bulimia, but sometimes anorexia nervosa). \\nIt’s important to get help for these conditions as well. \\nHow Common is Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)?\\nIt is estimated that 1-2 out of every 100 adults meet the criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD), with a\\nsimilar number of men and women. However, more women than men actually seek help.  \\nHow Is It Diagnosed?\\nIf you think that you or a loved one has many of the symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder outlined above,\\nthen consider an assessment by a psychologist or a psychiatrist. It is better to do this as early as possible, instead\\nof waiting for problems to get worse. Professional help can give a person the support and strategies that will help\\nthem (and their families!) to cope. \\nDoes It Get Better? \\nMost individuals who receive appropriate treatment will beneﬁt and show improvement.

It is in this zone that you can talk to them and try to problem-solve -- at\\nleast more easily than in other zones.\\nIs Your Loved One Emotionally Upset? (aka \"Yellow Zone\")\\nLife is stressful, and sensitive people can become easily triggered into a \"yellow zone.\" During these times, they\\nmay be upset, and need emotional support -- they need \"support not solutions\" (aka \"connection before direction\").\\nDo\\'s\\nDo start with \"support not solutions\" (aka \"connection before direction\".\\nSupport\\nSupport is about giving empathy, validation and acceptance, as opposed to starting with \"solutions\",\\nwhich is giving advice.\\nEmpathy is one of the most powerful ways to support an individual who is emotionally\\nsensitive.\\nYour loved one: \"I can\\'t believe my friend was so mean to me today.\"\\nYou: \"I\\'m so sorry to hear that!\" \"I\\'m here for you...

Or until your loved one is asking for it. All of\\nus need to be accepted and validated.

You might be tempted to start with giving your loved one advice, like \"You\\nshouldn\\'t cut, try your coping strategies instead,\" but it is better to connect ﬁrst.

For example,\\n“What’s causing you to feel upset?” “What stresses are you under?” You can then help resolve some of\\nthose stresses.\\nDon\\'ts\\nDon\\'t simply tell your loved one to stop self-injuring or make them feel guilty about it. This doesn’t help and\\nwill probably make things worse in the long run because your loved one may feel worse and will be less\\nlikely to turn to you or share feelings with you.

Many people with trauma or anxiety\\nreport trying their best to cope, or sometimes work with talk therapists or do cognitive\\nbehavioural therapy (CBT) to deal with their trauma, but still continue to feel bad and have\\nsymptoms. . Indeed, in many clients, standard talk therapies are of limited help perhaps\\nbecause their logical brains are overwhelmed by the stress and trauma which is held in their\\nemotional brains. In Brainspotting Therapy, a therapist guides the client with focused\\nmindfulness and speciﬁc eye positions. This allows painful or distressing memories to be\\nprocessed by the brain so that they are no longer distressing, allowing people to heal from past\\ntraumatic experiences. This method is also used to help people with anxiety, stress and worries,\\neating disorders, addictions, performance issues, and helping people work towards their goals\\nand dreams.\\nJ’s Story\\nJ has had a tough life. Her parents fought constantly, and her father left when she was young. Growing up, she was\\nbullied in school. She tried talking about her problems, but despite seeing many therapists, it never seemed to\\nhelp. Now in her 30’s, she had another crisis with a breakup of a relationship, and saw another counsellor. Instead\\nof talk therapy however, this counsellor is suggesting she try “brainspotting.”\\nJ. isn’t sure if she should try it or not…\\nQuote\\n“Where you look aﬀects how you feel…” -- David Grand\\nWhat is Brainspotting Therapy?\\nBrainspotting Therapy (BSP) is a brain-body based therapy involving eye positions that helps people overcome\\nstress, trauma and obstacles in their life.

For example, think about a signiﬁcant loss such as\\nlosing a pet. It can feel devastating at ﬁrst, but after talking about it, crying about it and getting support from\\nothers, one has “processed” the trauma and can move on.\\nHowever, when a person is exposed to signiﬁcant trauma (e.g. life threatening event), or repeated stress (e.g.\\nchronic bullying, abuse, neglect, life in a pandemic), then it can overwhelm the brain, leading to symptoms such as\\nlow mood, anxiety, sleep problems, trouble making decisions, obsessions, constant worries, and many more.\\nWhat Can Brainspotting Therapy Help with?\\nBrainspotting can help with a variety of situations, such as\\nPost-traumatic stress symptoms\\nAnxiety and phobias\\nAddictions to substances, sugar, gamlbling, and other behaviours\\nDepression\\nSomatic pain, including chronic pain\\nPerformance enhancement for athletes, actors, artists, public speakers, and more\\nWorking towards your goals or ideal self\\nWho Developed It?\\nBrainspotting therapy was developed by Dr. David Grand, a practitioner of eye movement desensitization and\\nreprocessing (EMDR), another type of trauma treatment which involves moving the eyes back and forth. He noticed\\nthat during EMDR, someclients would stop moving their eyes and stay focused on one spot. f He discovered\\ntherapeutic work using those eye positions could lead to rapid healing. He termed these eye positions, “brain\\nspots”.\\nHow Does Brainspotting Work?\\nDuring BSP, a therapist might guide the patient to:\\nThink about an issue or problem that troubles , such as memories of bad experiences, ﬁghts, physical pain,\\nor worries) The therapist will ask a few questions about the problem, but does not focus on an in-depth\\ndiscussion of the trauma.\\nThe therapist helps the client ﬁnd an eye position that feels\\nBe aware of how their body is feeling, e.g. noticing any tension in the head, neck, shoulders, stomach or\\nother areas;\\nListen to bilateral sounds, a type of music or nature sounds which move back and forth between right and\\nleft ears. Bilateral sound causes alternating activation of the right and left brain hemispheres and activates\\nthe parasympathetic, or calming, part of the nervous system.\\nThrough these and other interventions, the therapist helps the patient’s brain to reprocess their anxiety, trauma\\nand stress. When completed, clients report feeling calmer and more relaxed.\\nNote that although ideally it is done face-to-face, brainspotting can still be done virtually. This makes it very\\naccessible, even during the pandemic.\\nSelf-Help Strategies Using Brainspotting Principles\\nGazespotting\\nA gaze spot is a term for the natural position that we might look to when calm, or under stress.\\nDo’s\\nDo you notice that when you are stressed or anxious, that you look in a certain location?', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Brainspotting.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Bullying can be physical (e.g., hitting, pushing, tripping), verbal (e.g., name-calling, insults,\\nput-downs), social (e.g., social isolation, rumours) or cyber (e.g., threats or insults spread through the internet or\\ncell phone).\\n \\nIt is also possible for the same child to be both a bully and a victim. There are also \"provocative victims\" (a term\\ncoined by Olweus, 2001) who display negative behaviours that annoy bullies and lead them to take action.\\n \\nSchool bullies typically watch out for situations in which they know they can get away with bullying behaviour. \\nThey target other children that seem unlikely to be protected by other children.  They behave as bullies more\\nintensively at times and in places where there is not enough adult supervision.\\n \\nChildren who are neither bullies nor victims also play an important role in maintaining bullying or helping stop it. \\nBystanders can encourage the bullies, defend the victims, inform adult authorities, or do nothing at all.\\n \\nAlthough a great many children are victims of bullies at some point in their lives, only a very small minority are\\nvictimized regularly and repeatedly.  Research has shown that this minority is not very likely to \"outgrow\" the\\nproblems caused by the victimization.  Without help, chronic victims are often lonely, unhappy, and depressed for\\nmany years after the bullying has started. \\nSigns of Bullying \\nYour child might be being bullied if you notice that they:\\nDon\\'t talk much about school. Children who are being victimized may seem unclear or evasive when asked\\nhow their day went.\\nChange their route to school. They may ask to be driven directly to the school entrance in order to escape\\nfrom being bullied on the way. If they walk to school, they may choose an indirect route to avoid places\\nwhere bullies are known to gather.\\nHave unexplained physical complaints (e.g. headaches, stomach aches).\\nAppear sad, moody or irritable, particularly after coming home from school.\\nArrive home missing possessions or arrives home hungry (because the bully took their lunch or lunch\\nmoney).', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Bullying in Children and Youth_ Guide for Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Some parents were bullied themselves\\nand remember bullying as a normal part of growing up. It is not!\\nInform the school and work together with them.\\nTalk to your child about your concerns and ask about bullying. This can be challenging because bullies often\\nthreaten their victims with retaliation if adults are told about the bullying. Your child may be afraid of being\\na \"tattle-tale\", feel ashamed or embarrassed. Your child may believe that telling will make things worse or\\nthat adults may be unable or unwilling to do anything to help. Let your child know that in order for things to\\nget better, they can talk to a trusted adult so that others can help.\\nOF ALL THE THINGS YOU CAN DO, THE MOST IMPORTANT IS DIRECT ACTION TO STOP THE BULLYING.\\n \\nTHE FOLLOWING MAY HELP AS WELL:\\nSpend positive time with your child to build channels of communication. If you talk regularly with your child\\nand get to know their friends, it will be easier to pick up on possible bullying.\\nEncourage your child to participate in programs that enhance their self-conﬁdence, e.g. sports programs,\\nmartial arts programs, music programs\\nDo help your child with social skills. Social skills training is not likely by itself to end the bullying, teaching\\nyour child social skills so that they can form more friendships may help. You might enroll him/her in an\\norganized social skills group. The more friends your child has, the more protected they are from bullying.\\nDon\\'t try disciplining the bully without support from others. It is generally unwise to discipline other people\\'s\\nchildren. Consider informing the bully\\'s parents directly. If at school, inform the school. With bullying that is\\noccurring in other places (such as organized sports), inform those in charge (e.g. the coach).\\nConsider counselling for the victim in addition to direct action to stop the bully. Seeing a therapist/counsellor\\nmay help your child learn how to cope with the bullying as well as learn new ways of coping to avoid being a\\nvictim. However, the consensus of authorities in the ﬁeld favours a more direct approach in which the\\nbullying is stopped directly.\\nDo You Suspect Your Child is Bullying Others? \\nDo not excuse the bullying as being normal behaviour. Bullying is often the ﬁrst step to more serious\\nproblems such as skipping school, alcohol/drug use and even criminal activity.\\nInform the school and work together with them\\nIncrease supervision. Ask others about your child\\'s behaviour, rather than waiting for someone else to report\\nit.\\nTalk with your child and make it clear that bullying behaviour is not tolerated. The child must learn that\\nthere is no excuse for bullying. He/she will only learn that if adults accept no excuse.\\nIf there is bullying, intervene immediately with appropriate, non-physical consequences, e.g., removal of\\nprivileges for a period of time.\\nOF ALL THE THINGS YOU CAN DO, THE MOST IMPORTANT IS DIRECT ACTION TO STOP THE BULLYING.\\n \\nTHE FOLLOWING MAY HELP AS WELL:\\nGive praise for caring and respectful behaviours.\\nCreate opportunities for your child to do good things for others.\\nEliminate physical punishment in the home, as studies show bullies are often raised in home environments\\nwhere physical punishment is used.\\nModel non-aggressive ways of solving conﬂict.\\nAdults must not encourage any aggression, even in subtle ways.

There are several ways of\\ndoing this:\\nEnlist the help of other children who are not directly involved. These children should learn what bullying is\\nand what is wrong with it. They should be taught to inform adults immediately if they suspect someone is\\nbeing bullied.\\nAuthorities should talk together with the bully and their family. The bully ﬁnds out in this way that everyone\\nknows about the bullying. There should be an appropriate, brief, and non-physical consequence for the\\nbullying. It may be useful to increase supervision of the playground at recess time.\\nSome schools use packaged anti-bullying programs, in which teachers, pupils, and parents participate.  These\\nprograms usually include devising, implementing, and publicizing school policies against bullying.  School-wide\\ncampaigns raise awareness about the problem and encourage children to report bullying. Sometimes, children are\\ndesignated as special monitors to resolve conﬂict if they can or to report problems. These programs have been\\nsuccessful in some communities, schools and classes but unsuccessful in others.  Therefore, each intervention\\nshould be evaluated in a systematic way.\\n \\nAlthough it is important to advocate for anti-bullying programmes in schools and communities, it should not be\\nassumed that any program developed to ﬁght against bullying will work.

When one is a parent of a child with developmental and/or mental health\\nchallenges though, this can be more challenging. As they become young adults, they may\\nincreasingly want to assert their independence and autonomy. However, they may lack the\\ncapacity to make healthy decisions. Fortunately, there exist various ways to ensure that healthy\\ndecisions can continue to be made.\\nCase 1\\nDave is a 17-year-old with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He\\nhas never liked the fact that his parents set limits on his video games, and as a result, says he will move out so\\nthat “then no one will tell me what to do.” Unfortunately, he is not yet capable of managing money nor does he\\nhave the skills necessary to live on his own. When younger, he would occasionally run away and police would bring\\nhim back. Since he is aged 17 now, the police have told his parents that they will no longer be able to bring him\\nback unless they have a Power of Attorney for him.\\nWhat should parents do?\\nCase 2\\nMaya is a 17-year-old with mild to moderate intellectual disability who is dating an 18-year-old male. Maya wants\\nto move out with her boyfriend when she turns 18.\\nHowever, her parents are worried that her boyfriend simply wants to take advantage of her.

However, they may lack the capacity to make healthy decisions. \\nThe good news is that there are many things that parents can do to help ensure that their children are cared for.\\nShort-Term Solutions for Finances\\nIn the short run, parents often manage ﬁnances for their adult children by doing the following:\\nPaying the adult’s expenses (e.g. rent, bills) from the parent’s own funds; and/or\\nJoint bank account with the adult child, whereby the parent provides funds to pay for the adult child’s\\nexpenses.\\nIn the long run, however, there are other strategies that are preferable.\\nUsual Considerations\\nEnsure your own Will and ﬁnances are in order.\\nAre you the parent of the\\nadult child?YES\\n⇨• Ensure your own Will is in order.\\n• Review your ﬁnancial plan to ensure your adult child with a disability will\\nbe as well cared for as possible, e.g. Henson Trust, etc.\\nEnsure that your adult child makes a Will.\\nIs your child age 18 and in\\nOntario?YES\\n⇨• If so, then your child is legally an adult. At this age, your adult child can\\nmake a Will (provided they have capacity).\\n• See a lawyer, and have your child make a Will to deal with his/her assets -\\n- just in case.\\nRegister your child with MedicAlert’s local “autism registry” or “developmental services registry”.\\nDoes your adult child have\\ninteractions with the police?YES\\n⇨• In the event that your child has problems such as running away, and\\nneeding to be brought back by police, consider registering your child with the\\nlocal autism or developmental services registry.\\n• The proﬁle does not dictate a ﬁxed plan, but rather it is meant to provide\\nthe police with helpful suggestions should they need to intervene with your\\nchild, e.g. your child’s preferred nickname, favourite TV shows, food etc. By\\nknowing these things, it will be easier for police to connect with your child,\\nreduce anxiety and help with redirection.\\nDo you need to call the\\npolice?YES\\n⇨• If you do so, make sure you mention the registry to the police so that police\\ncan review it.\\nNavigate the system.\\nLearn about the local services in your area -- this is known as ‘system navigation’, and get connected to services\\nthat you need.\\nDoes the youth or adult child\\nhave a developmental disability\\nsuch as intellectual disability\\n(ID)?YES\\n⇨• In Ontario, consider Developmental Services of Ontario.\\n• In Ottawa, consider local agencies such as Service Coordination Support\\nand Developmental Services Ontario Eastern Region.\\nDoes the youth or adult child\\nhave autism spectrum disorder\\n(ASD)?YES\\n⇨• In Ontario, consider the Autism Society of Ontario (ASO)\\n• In Ottawa, consider Autism Ontario, Ottawa Chapter.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Capacity and Consent As Your Child Youth with Developmental Disabilities Becomes an Adult_ Information for Parents.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

If you or a loved one are hearing voices, it\\nis important to speak with a health professional to ensure that it is not a sign of more severe\\nproblems. However, in most cases, hearing voices does not indicate severe psychiatric illness.\\nBecause people with voices are often experiencing stress, one can start by being grateful to the\\nvoices for letting us know that there is stress. There are many ways to deal with voices, such as\\nlistening to the feelings that they express, and grounding techniques (focusing on one’s senses\\nsuch as seeing, hearing and touch).\\nDave’s Story\\nDave is a 10-yo boy who has started to hear voices. He has always been somewhat quiet, and not been that\\ntalkative about his thoughts and feelings. The voices appear triggered when he is under more stress, e.g. conﬂicts\\nwith classmates or not understanding work at school. When he is angry, the voices are angry. When he is feeling\\ngood, the voices are nice…\\nHow Common are Voices?\\nStudies show that voices are quite common, though the exact numbers vary depending on the study:\\nAt a single point in time\\nAbout 2-3% of the general population hears voices (Tien, 1991)\\nIn children, a study showed that 8% of children reported hearing voices.\\nAt any point in one’s life\\n5-15% of people will report hearing voices (Romme & Escher, 2001)\\nMost people who hear voices do not require mental health care.\\nOf the people who hear voices:\\nMost (⅔) are able to cope well enough that they do not require psychiatric care, nor do they receive any\\npsychiatric diagnosis. In these individuals, a common theme is that they accept the voices, and see them as', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Children Youth Who Hear Voices_ Information for Family and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

In patients, voices are\\ngenerally not accepted and seen as troublesome, distressing symptoms to be eliminated.\\nWho Hears Voices?\\nHearing voices can occur in many situations such as:\\nChildren who are otherwise ﬁne.\\nSchizophrenia\\nAnxiety\\nDepression\\nTrauma and dissociative disorders\\nMigraine\\nEven amongst professionals, there is often a misconception that voices automatically mean a condition such as\\nschizophrenia, but it is important to realize that voices can occur in many diﬀerent situations.\\nWhat People Say About Their Voices\\nAccording to a study of 153 people who heard voices (Woods, 2015):\\nMost (80% in one study) report hearing more than one voice, with 70% stating that they heard speciﬁc\\ncharacters\\n50% report their voices were sounds that they had heard\\n50% felt the voices were more like thoughts, or somewhere between sounds and thoughts\\n50% felt the voices were more like a voice\\n66% reported feeling bodily sensations (e.g. tingling or hot sensations in the hands or feet) while hearing\\nvoices)\\nSelf-Help for Voices: How to Support Your Child/Youth with Voices\\nLifestyle strategies.\\nHelp your child/youth by ensuring that they: \\nGet enough sleep. The average person in modern society does not get enough sleep. Ensure that your child\\nis handing in the electronics to parents and getting to sleep at an early enough time.\\nAvoid caﬀeine or stimulants. Stimulants such as caﬀeine or nicotine (from cigarettes) can worsen voices.\\nHave a healthy diet, without too much sugar or artiﬁcial processed foods. In some individuals, artiﬁcial\\nsweeteners, or food enhancers (such as monosodium glutamate) can be overstimulating for the brain. Try\\navoiding processed foods to see if it makes a diﬀerence.\\nAvoid sensory overload or situations that cause stress. In people with voices, often things are worsened if it\\nis too loud, too bright, too stimulating. Help create a quiet, calm environment for the person.\\nNature. Get outside with your loved one as nature is soothing for the brain, ideally at least 1-hr outside\\ndaily.\\nValidation and acceptance\\nAccept that the voices may carry some message, such as expressing a feeling, or distress. Some people\\nmay have troubles being aware of how they feel. The voices might be a way of expressing that which people\\nare unaware, or unable to express.\\nIf the voice is an angry voice, consider that perhaps your loved one may be feeling angry about\\nsomething (or worried about feeling angry), but been unable to express that.\\nIf the voice is a critical voice, consider that perhaps your loved one feels judged and worries about\\nnot being good enough.\\nGently ask your loved one if they might be having a certain feeling, and validate that it is okay to', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Children Youth Who Hear Voices_ Information for Family and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

It is true that certain behaviours are not good (e.g. harming yourself), but you\\ncan always validate the feelings (e.g. that everyone feels sad, or angry or overwhelmed at times).\\nDealing with stresses\\nHelp your loved one identify and cope better with stresses/triggers and emotions in general. In the\\nbeginning, it can seem like voices come out of nowhere. However, often there are speciﬁc stresses or\\ntriggers for the voices, and it helps to identify those.\\nYou might ask:\\n“When do the voices happen?” For example, if the voices always happen at school, it suggests there\\nmay be a stress with school.\\n“What else is happening around the time when the voices happen?”\\n“Is it possible that ___ might be a trigger?”\\n“Everyone has stresses. What stresses are you under at school? Work? Relationships?”\\nOnce you have identiﬁed the stresses, try to come up with a way to deal with each stress.\\nNon-talking / environmental strategies\\nReduce sensory overload. Some people are sensitive if things are too bright, too cluttered, too loud, too\\nstimulating. Especially if your loved one is getting upset, it may be helpful to:\\nReduce background noise\\nKeep your voice quiet -- many people are exquisitely sensitive and can be triggered if others raise their\\nvoice, or even change their tone of voice.\\nAsk others to give some space.\\nTry soothing sensory input, such as cuddling a pet, a heavy blanket, giving a back rub. Its best to do this\\nafter you\\'ve already discussed this ahead of time.\\nGrounding strategies.\\nGrounding techniques help the brain to get focused on compelling sensory input rather than the\\nhallucinations. When you notice your loved one starting to get stressed, consider grounding strategies such\\nas:\\n“5-4-3-2-1” exercise.\\nIf your child is upset, here are some things that parents can say to guide them through the\\ngrounding exercise:\\nOrient your child in case your child is disoriented\\nParent: “Hello (person’s name)... I’m here… It’s your mom.... It’s Saturday… We’re at home….”\\nParent: “Let’s think about 5 things that we can see…”\\nE.g. other people, things in the room or outside\\nDistraction\\nDo something to get your loved one\\'s mind oﬀ the voices and onto something else, such as:\\nListening to music\\nPhysical activity such as going for a walk with your loved one.\\nMental activity such as playing a game, doing a puzzle, doing coloring, etc.\\nMindfulness and relaxation activities\\nDo mindfulness and relaxation activities to feel calmer, which can reduce stress and thus can reduce voices\\nsuch as\\nYoga\\nApps such as Calm.com. \\nOther strategies that people with voices have reported as helpful are:\\nAgreeing to listen to the voices at certain times\\nListening selectively, e.g. accepting the things you like, and ignoring other things\\nSending the voices away, e.g. \"Thank you.

Yet despite all the progress that has been made in medical science, many people suﬀer\\nfrom physical symptoms for which there is no clear medical explanation. The good news\\nhowever, is that even if the exact cause is not known, many things can be done to help with\\nunexplained chronic medical symptoms.\\nWhat are Unexplained Chronic Medical Symptoms?\\nAt least 35% of people at some point have physical problems that are unexplained despite seeing their doctor.\\nMost of these are temporary and go away on their own (Steinbrecher, 2011).\\n \\nAs many as 3% of people may suﬀer from persistent physical symptoms which are not life-threatening, but there is\\nalso not any obvious cause (Steinbrecher, 2011).\\nWhat Causes It?\\nThere are many theories on why some people have problems with unexplained chronic symptoms:\\nHeightened sensitivity: Some people are simply more sensitive to physical sensations, and may be more\\naware of physical signals that other people are simply not aware of.\\nStress: Some people may be under the eﬀects of chronic stress. Chronic stress can cause all manner of\\nphysical and emotional symptoms, including low energy, headaches, stomach complaints, chest pain,\\ntroubles sleeping, and frequent infections. Typical stresses include work, family, and relationships.\\nTendency to want to avoid conﬂict: Some people have the strength of being kind and considerate, and are\\nable to forego their own needs and wishes, deferring to others. Unfortunately, when a person ignores their\\nown needs excessively, it can cause built up stress.\\nFamily history: Sometimes these conditions can run in families.\\nHow Do I Cope?\\nThe good news is that there are many things you can do:', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Chronic Unexplained Medical Symptoms.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 5\\nRecognize that you have stresses in your life -- like everyone does.  Everyone has stresses, such as\\nhome stress (such as relationships, kids, ﬁnances), work stress (such as the work itself, co-workers/bosses)\\nand school stress (such the academic work, and fellow students/teachers). Some people try to ignore and\\ndeny that they have stresses. Unfortunately, as far as your body is concerned, it still feels the stress. Stress\\nthat builds up in your body can worsen your medical symptoms.\\nIt can be helpful to:\\na) Acknowledge that you have stresses.\\nb) Identify what stresses you have -- is it home? Work? School? Relationships? \\nc) Come up with a plan to cope with each possible stress. \\n \\nFind meaning in your life rather than happiness. Because many people in modern societies search for\\nhappiness, you may see your medical symptoms as an obstacle to happiness. Paradoxically however, the\\nconstant search for happiness itself can be a barrier for happiness.\\n“It is the very pursuit of happiness that thwarts happiness.” – Viktor Frankl\\nPeople who are self-focused on making themselves “happy” (such as from having pleasurable experiences\\nsuch as going out and watching movies), but who have little-to-no sense of meaning, are not truly happier.\\nOn the other hand, studies show that you will feel happier if you feel connected to something greater than\\nyourself such as:\\nHelping or contributing to others such as family, pets, animals, the environment, the planet, those\\nless fortunate, etc...  \\nBeing part of a religious community\\nIf you can ﬁnd some meaning, some orientation to something bigger than yourself, then you will be closer to\\nfeeling genuine happiness…\\n“Be in the present moment, be open and curious, and devote your life to what matters. Do this and you are\\nliable to catch happiness along the way.” – Dr. T. Kashdan\\nSpend positive time with family and friends.  Human beings are a social species, and having good\\nrelationships with one another is good for both our emotional and physical health. If you ﬁnd that there are\\ndisagreements or conﬂicts getting into the way of your relationships, then speak with your primary care\\nprovider on how to cope or get help.\\n \\nShare how you feel with supportive friends and family.  Many people, particularly men, have been\\nconditioned to keep their stresses and emotions inside. Or you may have learned from past experiences that\\nsharing with others hasn’t been helpful. The truth however, is that as human beings, we are hard-wired to\\nhave emotions and to be social. It is in fact, these abilities that have made us the dominant species on this\\nplanet. No matter how much we may try to suppress this, the inescapable fact is that all of us are emotional\\nbeings that 1) have feelings and 2) feel a need to feel accepted by others. Let them know that you don’t\\nneed them to give advice or ﬁx your issue, but to just listen and be there for you.\\nFor example, you might say: “Can we talk? I just need you to listen. You don’t have to feel like you have to\\ngive me any advice or anything like that; it helps me just to know that you are listening.”\\n \\nDon’t just complain about your symptoms.  When you do talk with a loved one, try not to just focus on\\nyour symptoms, but just talk about your feelings. For example, if you have chronic abdominal pain, it is\\nbetter to not excessively complain about the pain, but rather let a loved one know that you are feeling\\nfrustrated and that it’d be nice to just sit with them for a few minutes together.\\n \\nPractice self-compassion. How do we treat a loved one who is suﬀering? With kindness, compassion and\\nacceptance. How do people treat themselves when they are suﬀering? Often times, we treat ourselves with\\nan inner critical voice, such as feeling blame, guilt, shame or non-acceptance. The solution is self-\\ncompassion, practiced for millennia by humankind -- because for most of human history, there has been\\ngreat suﬀering, with much less medical knowledge than nowadays. Self-compassion oﬀers a powerful way to\\ncope with human suﬀering, including unexplained, chronic medical symptoms.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Chronic Unexplained Medical Symptoms.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 3 / 5\\nGeneral prevention and lifestyle habits:\\nGet enough sleep: Sleep is restorative and this is particularly important if you have medical symptoms.\\nPoor sleep can worsen medical symptoms such as chronic pain. Try to have a regular bedtime routine,\\nfollowed by soothing activities in bed, such as reading or listening to calming music. Try to avoid looking at\\nan electronic screen, as the light tricks your brain into thinking its daytime (by blocking melatonin\\nproduction) and thus although entertaining, makes it harder to sleep.\\n \\nEat a healthy diet: Try your best to eat a healthy diet with regular meals. If you have abdominal or\\ndigestive issues, consider speaking to your primary care provider or dietician for speciﬁc advice in your\\nsituation.\\n \\nAvoid alcohol and street drugs: In general it is best to avoid alcohol and street drugs.  Note that there\\nare unique exceptions such as marijuana for certain types of chronic pain. If you are wondering if marijuana\\nmay be useful for you, speak to your primary care provider.\\n \\nAvoid smoking: As a general rule, avoiding smoking is important to prevent cardiovascular disease and\\ncancer.\\n \\nGet regular exercise:  Chronic pain can lead people to avoid exercise, however studies show that for\\nchronic pain, even small amounts of regular physical activity can be helpful. Speak to your physician before\\nstarting any exercise program, in order to ensure it is okay in your situation. Going for walks with a family\\nmember or friend is one of the easiest ways to get started. Start with brief walks and gradually increase.\\nFamily Support: What Can Friends and Family Do?\\nAs a friend or family member, it can be frustrating when your loved one has chronic medical symptoms. The good\\nnews, is that there are many ways that you can support your loved one:\\nAre you feeling frustrated at your friend or loved one? Its okay to feel frustrated. Underneath the frustration\\nis probably sadness over a loss. Having a loved one with chronic medical symptoms is a bit of a loss -- you\\nhave lost the healthy person that you wished that s/he was. You may even need to grieve the loss -- cry the\\ntears of loss, in order to grieve the loss of the healthy person that isn’t there anymore.\\n \\nAccept that you may not be able to change their medical situation, but at least you can oﬀer your support\\nand companionship so that they are not alone. Human beings can cope with all manner of medical distress,\\nbut being alone is the hardest.\\n \\nListen, validate and accept how your loved one feels.\\nWhen your loved one talks about his/her issues, listen and accept that this is how they are feel, and\\nexpress that you are grateful that they are sharing their concerns with you.\\nIf he/she appears to be dwelling on their medical symptoms, then try to listen for the feelings\\nunderneath the complaints (e.g. frustration, anger, sadness, fear, loneliness). You might say, “Thank\\nyou for telling me about your back pain today. It sounds like its very frustrating.”\\nValidate and accept that they feel that way. You might say, “I can appreciate how you’d feel that\\nway. It doesn’t sound easy.”\\nAsk them how you can be supportive. You might say: “How can I be helpful?” “What can I do to be\\nsupportive?”\\n \\nDo not judge, criticize, nor give advice unless it is asked for. Deep down, we all simply want to be accepted.\\nUnfortunately, when we give unsolicited advice to another person, it can be misinterpreted as saying that\\nwe want them to change, and thus, that we do not accept them. It may seem paradoxical, but if you want\\nyour loved one to be more open to your advice, start by simply accepting them.\\n \\nProvide practical support by doing things together with your loved one, such as going shopping together,', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Chronic Unexplained Medical Symptoms.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Deep\\npressure can be a powerful strategy to help people feel calmer.\\nWhat are Weighted Interventions?\\nMany people ﬁnd it soothing to feel snug. Perhaps this dates back to being in the womb, where we were all snuggly\\ncompressed inside the womb. And when babies are born, for centuries, people have been tightly swaddling their\\nbabies. As people grow older, many children, youth and even adults continue to enjoy:\\nHugs\\nMassage\\nBeing underneath a heavy blanket\\nBeing underwater.\\nInterventions such as heavy blankets give us ‘deep pressure’, which act on the receptors in the skin, muscles and\\njoints, and can help when:\\nWe are understimulated and need more stimulation., e.g. enjoying a nice massage. \\nWe are overwhelmed and need soothing stimulation, e.g. being upset and getting a hug, or cuddling under a\\nblanket. \\n(Creation Messim Weighted Blanket) ( www.fdmt.ca)', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Deep Pressure including Weighted Blankets and Animals.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

It happens due to a biological diﬀerence where the person’s\\ninternal clock is delayed by 2-hrs or more. DSWPD is not due to a person being lazy or\\nunmotivated. The good news is that many things can be done to adjust the person's internal\\nclock to ﬁt better with the demands of society.\\nD’s Story, Part 1\\nD. is a young adult living at home with his parents. When he was younger, he could go to bed by 9 PM and wake up\\nfor 6 AM. But ever since becoming a teenager, when 9 PM comes around, he is simply not tired and seems to get\\na “second wind. Various strategies have been tried, including putting away all electronics by 8 PM and trying\\ncalming activities before bedtime. He ﬁnally falls asleep at 1 AM. Unfortunately, then he struggles to get up at 8\\nAM for school, even with multiple alarms and parents' eﬀorts to wake up.

       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 5\\nWhat is Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD)?\\nDSWPD is a sleep disorder characterized by a discrepancy between one’s circadian clock’s internal setting and the\\nsleep-wake schedule required by home, school or work obligations. The person has trouble getting to sleep on\\ntime, ends up going to bed too late, and then ends up exhausted when they have to wake up the following day. It\\ncauses signiﬁcant distress and impairs one’s social, educational or occupational functioning (American Psychiatric\\nAssociation, 2013).\\nWhen the person tries to sleep like everyone else (e.g. go to bed at 11 PM, wake up at 7 AM), their sleep quality is\\nvery poor. However, they have signiﬁcant improvements in their sleep when they go to bed later and wake up\\nlater.\\nNormal Sleep Physiology\\nSleep timing is controlled by the master circadian clock, located in a part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic\\nnucleus. This clock determines what time we should go to sleep and what time we wake up. Our clock requires\\nconstant “resetting” by external time cues (aka “zeitgebers”), and the most important ones that set our clock\\ninclude exposure to sunlight during the morning and daytime, as well as exposure to darkness in the evenings.\\nOther time cues that inﬂuence this biological clock include physical activity, mealtimes, and work /social schedules.\\nWhat Causes Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase?\\nIn normal adolescence, there is a shift towards a delayed sleep phase in puberty, where adolescents will need to\\ngo to bed later and wake up later. This sleep phase then advances with each decade. In people with DSWPD, this\\nshift is more extreme. If these persons try to work/live in a typical societal schedule (e.g. try to sleep from 11 PM to\\n7 AM), they can experience signiﬁcant problems due to the mismatch between their social / work schedule and\\ntheir internal clock (circadian phase).\\nThere seems to be a link between those with DSWPD and conditions such as ADHD and bipolar disorder.\\nCould I Have Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase?\\nTwo ways to really conﬁrm if you might have delayed sleep-wake phase are:\\n1) Consider doing the Morning-Eveningness Questionnaire\\nhttps://chronotype-self-test.info/index.php?sid=61524&newtest=Y\\nThe results of this questionnaire will help inform whether you are a morning type (\"lark\"), intermediate type, or\\nevening type (\"night owl\").\\nDid you identify as an evening type? If so, then you may be at higher risk of DSWPD.\\n2) Do you have the opportunity to take a vacation for two weeks with no obligations where you can sleep and wake\\nup whenever you feel most comfortable?\\nIf so, then track this with sleep logs, or a wearable sleep-tracking device. \\nDo you ﬁnd your most \"comfortable sleep\" starts after 2 AM, and wake-up time is routinely 10 AM or later? This\\nmeans you may have an increased risk of DSPWD.\\nI Think I Have Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase… What Now?\\nWondering about delayed sleep-wake phase?\\nFirst, start by gathering information about your sleep.\\nKeep a sleep diary or sleep log. Ways to do this include: a) downloading a paper log from the\\ninternet; b) using a sleep tracking app; c) using a wearable sleep type device that tracks your sleep\\ndata. Typically, when people with DSWPD can go to bed later and sleep in, their sleep quantity and\\nquality will improve.\\nIf so, then see your healthcare provider.\\nShow your health care provider the information.\\nThe health care provider may also ask questions to see if you might have other sleep issues, such as', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Delayed Sleep Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD).pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Depression, on the other\\nhand, is a sadness so severe that it can cause:\\nDiﬃculties functioning at home, work or school\\nChanges in sleep, energy, appetite and concentration,\\nFeelings such as sadness, anxiety, irritability or anger,\\nLow self-esteem or feelings of hopelessness. When extremely severe, people who are depressed may have\\nthoughts of hurting themselves.\\nHow Common is Depression?\\nDepression is a common condition that can aﬀect anyone at any age. In any given year, it is estimated that it\\naﬀects almost 1 in 10 adults each year, aﬀecting more women than men. Although it can occur at any age, it\\nusually starts in the late teens to mid-20s.\\nSymptoms of Depression\\nSymptoms of depression include (but are not limited to) the following:\\nSad, depressed (or irritable) mood most days\\nLoss of interest or enjoyment in activities\\nProblems with appetite\\nProblems with sleep\\nProblems with concentration\\nFeeling guilty, hopeless, or worthless.\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Depression in Adults.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Many factors can contribute to depression:\\nFamily history of depression: if other people in the family have had troubles with depression, it may make\\nsomeone at higher risk.\\nStressful life situations or events, such as problems with relationships, or stresses at work, home or school.\\nParticularly stressful situations may include childhood abuse or neglect, separation/divorce, or conﬂicts.\\nImbalances in neurotransmitters can be triggered by lack of sunlight, drug use, medications, or medical\\nproblems.\\nHow is Depression Treated?\\nThere are numerous eﬀective treatments for depression, which mental health professionals generally give.\\n \\nCommonly used therapies include:\\nCognitive behaviour therapy (CBT): Helps individuals cope with depression by focusing on changing their\\nthoughts and behaviours. In depression, individuals tend to have negative, depressive thoughts. In CBT,\\nindividuals learn to replace depressive thoughts with more positive, helpful thoughts.\\nInterpersonal psychotherapy (IPT): Helps with depression by focusing on improving relationships. Regardless\\nof how the depression started, individuals with depression tend to have tension in their relationships from\\neither 1) conﬂict or withdrawal or 2) life transitions or changes. IPT helps improve these diﬃculties.\\nSolution-focused therapy: Helps by ﬁnding solutions. In depression, individuals tend to focus on life stresses\\nand problems. In solution-focused therapy, individuals get support in ﬁnding solutions to these diﬃculties.\\nMedications: These may be helpful in certain cases, which may be prescribed by a family physician,\\npediatrician, or psychiatrist. Medications are generally used only when other treatments have not been\\nsuccessful or when the depression is so severe that other treatments are impossible.\\nDepending on the severity of the depression, more intensive support and services may be required, such as\\nadmission to a hospital.\\nHelping Someone Who is Depressed\\nIf you know someone who is depressed, it aﬀects you too. The ﬁrst and most important thing you can do to help a\\nfriend or relative who has depression is to help them ﬁnd an appropriate diagnosis and treatment. You may need to\\nmake an appointment on their behalf and go with them to see the doctor. Encourage them to stay in treatment or\\nto seek diﬀerent treatment if no improvement occurs after six to eight weeks.\\n \\nTo help a friend or relative:\\nOﬀer emotional support, understanding, patience and encouragement.\\nEngage your friend or relative in conversation, and listen carefully.\\nNever disparage feelings your friend or relative expresses, but point out realities and oﬀer hope.\\nNever ignore comments about suicide, and report them to your friend's or relative's therapist or doctor.\\nInvite your friend or relative out for walks, outings and other activities. Keep trying if they decline, but don't\\npush them to take on too much too soon. Although diversions and company are needed, too many demands\\nmay increase feelings of failure.\\nRemind them that with time and treatment, the depression will lift.\\n \\n(Adapted from the National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH), retrieved from\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Depression in Adults.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

This method is known as behavioural activation and has been shown in studies to be an eﬀective treatment\\nfor depression. \\n \\nThe following strategies have antidepressant properties and can improve both physical and mental health: \\nPractice self-acceptance and self-compassion. One of the problems of depression is that many of us\\ntend to have a self-critical voice that makes us feel guilty or ashamed for being depressed. Perhaps it\\'s\\nbecause we think that being self-critical will be helpful, but unfortunately, it usually doesn\\'t help and makes\\nus feel worse. There is an alternative... Accept that you are imperfect and ﬂawed because, after all, you are\\nonly human. Humans get depressed, and you are human. Every one of us is ﬂawed and imperfect, and\\nhence we do suﬀer from depression and other problems. At the same time, it means you are not alone...\\nDo you struggle at ﬁnding that self-compassionate voice? If so, try to think about what you\\'d tell a friend\\nwho is suﬀering from depression or dealing with a diﬃculty? You\\'d say things like, \"It\\'s okay, I\\'m here with\\nyou...\" Try to work at being a bit more accepting and supportive of yourself.

Recognizing depression is extremely important because getting help early on makes\\na diﬀerence and helps prevent childhood depression from becoming adult depression.\\nWhat is Depression?\\nIt is normal for children and youth to feel sad from time to time.  But this sadness doesn’t stop them from going on\\nwith their everyday activities.  And it goes away on its own.  Depression, on the other hand, is a sadness so severe\\nthat it interferes with everyday life.  \\nTypical symptoms of depression (aka clinical depression, or major depressive disorder) are:\\nFeeling sad, worried, irritable or angry.\\nLack of enjoyment in life, or troubles enjoying anything\\nFeeling hopeless and worthless, \\nTroubles coping with everyday activities at home, school, or work\\nProblems with sleep, energy, appetite and concentration\\nWith severe depression, a person may even hear voices or have thoughts of harming themselves or others.\\nDepression is more than normal sadness.  A depressed person can’t ‘just snap out of it.'  Studies even show actual\\nphysical changes in a person’s brain when they have clinical depression.\\nHow Common is Depression?\\nDepression is common.  Researchers believe that about 1 in 5 children and youth will go through depression by\\nturning 18.  Studies also tell us that between 4 and 8 out of every 100 children and youth are having major\\ndepression at any one moment.  Sadly, most people with depression do not get help.  But getting help is important\\nbecause there are eﬀective treatments, and early treatment can stop it from coming back in the future (AACAP,\\n2007).\\nWhat Causes Depression?\\nSometimes parents feel guilty that they caused their child’s depression.

Yet with depression, people\\noften struggle with getting help. Instead of causing pain on the outside, depression causes pain on the inside.  But\\nyou still need to help your child with this pain.  If you think your child might be depressed, start by taking him to a\\ndoctor (like your family doctor or pediatrician), and describe the changes you’re noticing in his behaviour and\\nfeelings.  The doctor can check for medical problems that might be causing the depression.

They can be used alone or together, depending on your\\nchild.  Some treatments work well with some children but not with others.  If a treatment isn’t working (after giving\\nit a good try, of course), your mental health professional may talk with you and your child about trying something\\nelse.\\n \\n“Talk Therapy” or Psychotherapy\\nThere are diﬀerent types of talk therapy, which include (but are not limited to):\\nCognitive behaviour therapy (CBT): Helps individuals cope with depression by focusing on changing their\\nthoughts and behaviours.

I have some ideas myself, but what things would you like to do?\"\\nHelp your child ﬁgure out what stresses s/he is under, and then help your child problem-solve ways to deal\\nwith those stresses. This usually involves reducing the stress and/or teaching the child ways to cope with\\nthose stresses. If you have an adolescent/youth, they may present as less open to your ideas. It could be\\nmore helpful to preface the discussion with \"I have some ideas about managing stress that may help you,\\nwould you like to hear them?\"\\nEnsure that your child is physically healthy by getting good nutrition, sleep and exercise.

Depression, on the other hand, is a sadness so severe that it interferes with\\neveryday life.\\nYouth going through a depression often:\\nFeel sad, worried, irritable or angry \\nHave trouble enjoying anything \\nFeel hopeless and worthless \\nHave trouble coping with everyday activities at home, school, or work \\nHave trouble doing simple things, like having a shower or brushing teeth \", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Depression in Youth_ Youth Edition.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

A depressed person can’t ‘just snap out of it’. Studies even show physical\\nchanges in people’s brain chemistry when they are depressed.  \\nHow Common is Depression?\\nits not just you. Depression is very common. \\n \\nStudies show that about 1 in 5 people will go through a depression by the time they turn 18. \\n \\nGetting help is important, because there are eﬀective treatments for depression. Early treatment can stop\\ndepression from coming back in the future.  \\nWhat Causes Depression?\\nThere is no one single cause for depression -- rather, there are diﬀerent things that can add to it:\\nFamily history: If there have been people in the family with depression or stress, there is a bigger chance\\nthat you may have depression. The good news is that this means they will hopefully be more understanding\\nof what you are going through. \\nStresses in life, such as problems with parents, brothers and sisters; problems with peers (e.g. bullying);\\nschool stresses; losing someone close to you; many others. \\nI Think I'm Depressed -- What Should I Do?\\nWhat would you do if you had a broken arm? You'd get help right away from an adult, like telling your parents, a\\nteacher or a health professional like a doctor. \\n \\nIts the same with depression. \\n \\nYou can: \\nTalk to an adult that you trust, e.g. your parents, your teacher, guidance counselor or your doctor. Parents\\nor a trusted adult can help you see a doctor. Let the doctor know how you’re feeling. S/he can check for\\nmedical problems that might be causing the depression. The doctor may suggest mental health services,\\nand can help you link with psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers or counsellors.\\nNobody to talk to? \\nCall a crisis line  to get help. That's what they are there for.  \\nHow Does Depression Get Better? \\nWhen you see a professional, they can help in diﬀerent ways. Every person is diﬀerent. Some treatments work well\\nwith some youth, but not with others. If a treatment isn’t working (after giving it a good try, of course), your\\nprofessional may talk with you about trying something else. Its okay if something doesn't work -- there are many\\ndiﬀerent treatments (and professionals) out there. \\nStart with Healthy Lifestyle\\nDo's \\nGet enough sleep -- at least 8-11 hours daily for a teenager.

Studies show that being outside in nature is a powerful antidepressant, especially in the\\nsunlight. \\nSpend face to face time with other people. Human beings are social -- we need face-to-face time with other\\npeople. Don\\'t expect others to be your therapist. Start by just doing healthy things together, like going for a\\nwalk outside. \\nDon\\'ts \\nDon\\'t turn to video games, internet and screens to feel better. A little bit of screen time a day is okay (up to\\n1-2 hrs/daily max), but any more than that, it stops you from being able to do the things that help your\\nmood. Like get enough sleep, spend time outside, or be with people face-to-face. \\nDon\\'t use street drugs and alcohol to feel better. While getting high can sometimes make you feel better at\\nﬁrst, it eventually makes things worse, not to mention costing a lot of money.  \\nTalk Therapies \\n1.   \"Talk Therapy\" or Psychotherapy\\n   \\nTalking therapy is when you see a counselor/therapist and talk about what is going on, and come up with solutions.\\nThere are many types of talking therapies, which include cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT); dialectical behaviour\\ntherapy (DBT); interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), and many others. \\n \\nAdvantage: When you receive talk therapy, you can learn new ways to cope that can help you for a very long time.\\n \\nDisadvantage: It takes eﬀort to see a therapist for talk therapy. \\nMedications\\nWhen talking therapies haven\\'t helped, doctors may recommend trying a medication. \\n \\nAdvantages: They can be helpful when other things haven\\'t help. \\n \\nDisadvantage: They may have side eﬀects. Some people are worried about being \\'dependent\\' or \\'being weak\\' if\\nthey take medications. On the other hand, if you had asthma, would you think it would be better to ‘get over it’\\nwithout treatment?\\n \\nAre antidepressants safe? Some people are worried about the safety of antidepressants for youth. Research shows\\nthat when used in the right way, and monitored by a doctor, antidepressants are safe and eﬀective. Like\\nprescription eye-glasses, medications must be chosen and adjusted for each child or teen.\\nWhile some people have strong views about medications for depression – a balanced look at antidepressant\\ntreatment is the most helpful. Medications are not all bad, but they are not needed all the time, either.  \\nOutpatient and Inpatient Services \\nYouth with depression are usually treated in ‘outpatient’ clinics or community mental health centres.

They may have problems with being clumsy, poorly coordinated which\\nleads to dropping things or bumping into things. There may be gross motor problems that make\\nit diﬃcult to learn to ride a bike or do sports. There may be ﬁne motor coordination problems\\nsuch as poor printing and handwriting that make school diﬃcult. The good news is that there are\\nmany things that can be done to help. Professionals that can help include occupational\\ntherapists (OT) or physiotherapists (PT).\\nMax's Story\\nMax has always been clumsy. But it seems that as he gets older, it's not something he is growing out of, and\\nstarting to really cause noticeable problems. He is clumsy and spills things at home all the time, leading family\\nmembers to get upset at him. He is always walking or falling on something leading to frequent bumps and bruises.\\nAt school, he struggles to learn how to write. He struggles with gym class, and at recess, wishes he could play with\\nthe other kids but he is so clumsy that no one wants to play with him.\\nAny of the Following?\\nDoes your child seem excessively clumsy, to the point that it causes problems at home, school or work?\\nDoes your child have problems with learning how to ride a tricycle, bicycle, catching a ball, doing jumping\\njacks?\\nDoes your child have problems with writing or printing?\\nIf so, then your child may have developmental coordination disorder (DCD)…\\nWhat is Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD)?\\nDevelopmental coordination disorder (DCD), also known as dyspraxia, occurs when a delay in the development of\\nmotor skills, or diﬃculty coordinating movements, results in a child being unable to perform everyday tasks.\\nGood coordination is an essential skill for all day-to-day activities such as dressing in the morning, writing/typing\\nduring the day, and playing sports.

For a child with DCD, performing motor skills requires signiﬁcant eﬀort. Fatigue\\nand repeated failure may cause the child to avoid participating in motor tasks.\\nThe child may avoid socializing with peers, particularly on the playground. Some children will seek\\nout younger children to play with while others will play on their own or follow the educator or\\nplayground supervisor. This may be due to decreased self-conﬁdence or avoidance of physical\\nactivities.\\nThe child may appear anxious in social situations, because the child may actively avoid tasks that\\nrequire motor skills, out of fear of being embarrassed\\nFrustration\\nThe child may demonstrate a low frustration tolerance, decreased self-esteem, and a lack of\\nmotivation due to diﬃculties coping with activities that are required in all aspects of his/her life.\\nThe child may seem dissatisﬁed with his/her performance (e.g., erases written work, complains of\\nperformance in motor activities, shows frustration with work product).\\nThe child may appear hyperactive because due to troubles stabilizing his/her body, the child may\\nappear restless\\nResistance to changes\\nThe child may be resistant to changes in his/her routine or his/her environment.

Try to review any rules and\\nroutines that are associated with the activity (e.g., baseball rules, soccer plays) at a time when the child is\\nnot concentrating on the motor aspects. Ask the child simple questions to ensure comprehension (e.g.,\\n\"What do you do when you hit the ball?\").\\nPrivate lessons may be helpful at certain points in time to teach the child-speciﬁc skills, e.g. private lessons\\nto learn how to bike; private lessons for skating, swimming, etc.\\nLet coaches, instructors, babysitters, child care providers understand the child’s strengths and challenges so\\nthey can support and encourage them to be successful.\\nAccept that your child may prefer individual sports (e.g. swimming, running, bicycling, skiing) rather than\\nteam sports (e.g. soccer, hockey, etc.). If you do try team sports like soccer or hockey, consider giving your\\nchild extra opportunities to practice those skills. Martial arts is an interesting compromise, as it allows\\npeople to work at their own pace, yet still being in a group setting.\\nEncourage the child to wear clothing to school that is easy to get on and oﬀ. For example, sweat pants,\\nsweatshirts, t-shirts, leggings, sweaters, and Velcro shoes. When possible, use Velcro closures instead of\\nbuttons, snaps or shoelaces. Teach the child how to manage diﬃcult fasteners when you have more time\\nand patience (e.g., on the weekend, or over the summer) rather than when you are pressured to get out the\\ndoor.\\nEnsure safety through the use of protective gear (wrist guards, helmets) with physical activities.\\nEncourage interaction with peers through non-competitive, non-physical activities.

School Accommodations and Modiﬁcations\\nfor DCD\\nWork together with educators to ensure they understand your child’s speciﬁc needs. Meet with the educator near\\nthe beginning of the school year to discuss your child’s speciﬁc diﬃculties and to make suggestions about\\nstrategies that have worked well.\\nClassroom accommodations and modiﬁcations are recommended for DCD such as the following:\\nUnderstand that the child may struggle with ﬁne and gross motor skills. As a result, the child will need the\\ncurriculum to be ﬂexible around diﬃculties with motor skills.\\nEnsure that the child is positioned properly for deskwork. Make sure that the child\\'s feet are ﬂat on the ﬂoor,\\nand that the desk is at an appropriate height with the shoulders relaxed and the forearms comfortably\\nsupported on the desk.\\nSet realistic short-term goals. This will ensure that both the child and educator continue to be motivated.\\nProvide the child with extra time to complete ﬁne motor activities such as math, printing, writing a story,\\npractical science tasks, and artwork. If speed is necessary, be willing to accept a less accurate product.\\nWhen copying is not the emphasis, provide the child with prepared worksheets that will allow him/her to\\nfocus on the task. For example, provide children with prepared math sheets, pages with questions already\\nprinted, or \\'ﬁll in the blank\\' for reading comprehension questions. For study purposes, photocopy notes\\nwritten by another child.\\nAllow the early use of keyboards to make it easier for the child to express himself. Provide teaching (if\\nrequired) about how to type, and do not assume that the child will just learn how to type on his/her own.\\nTeach children speciﬁc handwriting strategies that encourage them to print or write letters in a consistent\\nmanner. Use thin magic markers or pencil grips if they seem to help the child improve pencil grasp or to\\nreduce pencil pressure on the page.\\nUse paper that matches the child\\'s handwriting diﬃculties.\\nFor example:\\nwidely spaced lines for a child who writes with very large lettering;', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD).pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

If a creative story is the goal, then accept\\nmessy handwriting, uneven spacing and multiple erasures. If the goal is to have the child learn to set up a\\nmath problem correctly, then allow time to do it even if the math problem does not get solved.\\nConsider using a variety of presentation methods when asking the child to demonstrate comprehension of a\\nsubject. For example, encourage children to present a report orally, use drawings to illustrate their\\nthoughts, type a story or report on the computer, or record a story or exam on a tape recorder.\\nConsider allowing the child to use a keyboard for writing the draft and ﬁnal copies of reports, stories and\\nother assignments. If it is important to see the “non-edited” product, ask the child to submit both the draft\\nand ﬁnal versions.\\nProvide additional time, and/or computer access, for tests and exams that require a lot of written output.\\nIn Physical Education:\\nBreak down the physical activity into smaller parts while keeping each part meaningful and achievable.\\nChoose activities that will ensure success for the child at least 50% of the time and reward eﬀort, not skill.\\nIncorporate activities that require a coordinated response from arms and/or legs (e.g., skipping, bouncing\\nand catching a large ball).\\nEncourage children to develop skills using their hands in a dominant/assistant fashion (e.g., using a baseball\\nbat or a hockey stick).\\nKeep the environment as predictable as possible when teaching a new skill (e.g., place a ball on a T-ball\\nstand). Introduce changes gradually after each part of the skill has been mastered.\\nMake participation, not competition, the major goals. With ﬁtness and skill-building activities, encourage\\nchildren to compete with themselves, not others.\\nAllow the child to take on a leadership role in physical education activities (e.g., captain of the team,\\numpire) to encourage them to develop organizational or managerial skills.\\nModify equipment to decrease the risk of injury to children who are learning a new skill. For example, Nerf\\nballs in graduated sizes can be used to develop catching and throwing skills.\\nWhen possible, provide hand-over-hand guidance to help the child get the feel of the movement - for\\nexample, by asking the child to help the educator demonstrate a new skill to the class. Also, talk out loud\\nwhen teaching a new skill, describing each step clearly.\\nFocus on understanding the purpose and the rules of various sports or physical activities. When a child\\nunderstands clearly what he/she needs to do, it is easier to plan the movement.\\nGive positive, encouraging feedback. If providing instruction, describe the movement changes speciﬁcally\\n(e.g., “you need to lift your arms higher”).\\nAbout this Document\\nWritten by Dr. Cheryl Missiuna, along with members of the CHEO Mental Health Information Committee.

Some people are simply wired diﬀerently, and it is harder for their brains to self-\\nregulate than others. It is important to recognize when a child is having problems with\\ndysregulation, as there are many ways to support such a child to be more successful at home\\nand school.\\nDavid’s Story\\nDave is a 10-yo youth who has always had a spirited temperament. He is always easily irritated and easily\\ntriggered to have tantrums, on a daily basis, several times a day. Triggers for anger include making any sort of\\nrequests that take him away from a preferred activity (e.g. if parents ask him to get oﬀ the TV and come for\\ndinner), or if he has a wish and parents say no (e.g. he wants to have another cookie and parents say no.) As he is\\ngetting older, his tantrums are harder to manage as he gets bigger. He has kicked holes in the walls and broken his\\ndoor.\\nParents have tried various parenting strategies (including making clear expectations with positive/negative\\nrewards), but nothing so far seems to work.\\nDoes your child/youth have:\\nAngry outbursts and explosions that are easily triggered by day-to-day expectations?\\nSeem to be angry and irritable most of the time, for at least the past year?\\nIf so, then read on to learn more…\\nAbout Anger\\nEveryone gets angry from time to time. Anger is a natural reaction when people feel under threat, or when they\\nfeel something is unfair. Anger serves to let us know that something isn’t quite right, and can be a helpful signal\\nfor people to take action. If you never get angry, there is a risk you may get taken advantage of by others.\\nOn the other hand, if a person is constantly angry and irritable, this tends to cause problems at home, work or\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD).pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

And it may be a condition such as disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD)... \\nWhat is Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)?\\nAccording to the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM-5), DMDD is deﬁned as the following:\\nSevere, recurrent verbal or behavioural angry outbursts out of proportion to the situation\\nNot appropriate to the developmental level, i.e. it would not be abnormal for a toddler to have tantrums;\\nhowever, tantrums in a school-aged children.\\nHappen on average three times a week\\nHappens in at least two settings, i.e. home, school, peers.\\nPersistent irritable or angry most of the day, early every day, between outbursts\\nAt least 12 months (symptom free periods not exceeding 3 months a year)\\nOnset <10 years old (diagnosed >6 years but <18 years old)\\nNot due to bipolar disorder (such as hypomania or mania)\\nNot occurring during periods of major depression\\nNot due to substance use, medications or another mental health condition\\nDMDD is a relatively new diagnosis. It was created in an eﬀort to better help those with severe anger. Prior to this\\ndiagnosis, people with severe, longstanding anger were often felt to have bipolar disorder, thus started on bipolar\\nmedications. As a result, the diagnosis of DMDD was created to help ﬁnd better ways of supporting such\\nindividuals.\\nThe Role of “Easy Dopamine”\\nParents often report that their child/youth are triggered by the following: \\nAsking the person to stop doing a preferred activity (e.g. if parents ask him to get oﬀ the TV)\\nAsking the person to start doing some other daily routine (e.g. come to the dinner table, do homework, do\\nchores)\\nWhen the person wants something (e.g. wants to watch TV, or wants something with sugar).\\nOne theory for such outbursts is the following:\\nWhen a person is using a recreational screen (e.g. video game or TV), or when eating high sugar foods, the\\nbrain receives a small dose of pleasure chemicals, speciﬁcally dopamine.\\nHuman brains crave things that provide dopamine, which is the same chemical that other addictive things\\ngive us (such as cocaine, opioids, marijuana, alcohol, etc.)\\nWhen a person with DMDD is asked to stop using their TV (or denied another cookie), it is understandable\\nthat their brain becomes upset, because now they are losing their source of dopamine.\\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\\nQuestion: Why label someone with DMDD? Doesn’t everyone get angry from time to time?\\nAnswer: It is true that everyone gets angry from time to time. DMDD is more than just normal anger. DMDD refers\\nto those people who have severe, recurrent anger, to the point it causes problems in their lives. Studies show that\\npeople with DMDD go on to experience signiﬁcant problems in their lives as they grow older. The good news, is by\\nidentifying those with DMDD, this gives opportunities to provide support and help with their anger.\\nQuestion:  Is DMDD the same as bipolar?\\nAnswer: DMDD describes people who have long standing anger most of the time. On the other hand, with bipolar,\\npeople have distinct episodes where they have symptoms. Making the distinction is important, as treatments are\\ndiﬀerent for bipolar (such as possibly requiring mood stabilizers such as lithium).\\nOther Conditions Where Anger can be Seen', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD).pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Life is stressor, and many stresses and triggers can get us upset (i.e. “yellow zone”), or\\ncompletely overwhelmed, perhaps even in a ﬁght/ﬂight mode (i.e. “red zone”). Self-regulation is about\\nlearning what triggers someone, and what strategies work to help someone get back to the green zone.\\nPrograms include:\\nHow Does Your Engine Run?\\nZones of Regulation\\nConnection before direction\\nThe theory with connection before direction, is that with certain kids, it is imported to connect with them\\nﬁrst, prior to give them instructions, or direction (or correction).\\nPreviously\\nParent: “Time for dinner!”\\nChild: “Just 5 more minutes!”\\nTry instead\\nParent: “Hey, how’s it going?”\\nChild: “Good.

This is derived from studies on\\neye health, showing that at least 1-hr outside is required to help prevent nearsightedness.\\nLimiting screen time. If there are angry outbursts when asked to stop using screen time, then it suggests a\\nmild screen addiction. The child’s brain has become accustomed to the ‘easy dopamine’ that the screen\\ntime provides. And when the screentime is removed, the withdrawal of ‘easy dopamine’ leads to anger and\\nfrustration.\\nEncourage non-electronic activities.

As a result, they may have frequent periods of dissociation and spacing out in\\nresponse to stress. Because you do not remember what happens during a dissociative episode,\\nit causes gaps in your memory and it is as if you have a diﬀerent identity. The good news is that\\nthere are many strategies and treatments to support those with DID.\\nMary's Story\\nMary is 30-years old. She lives on her own, and does not have any contact with her family. She has no memory of\\nher childhood at all. She is a gentle person, and works in an oﬃce. Sometimes she meets people who say that they\\nknow her, however she has no recollection of having met them. What is going on with Mary?\\nCould I have Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)?\\nDo you notice any of the following?\\nA feeling that your sense of self has two or more distinct parts, and that each of those parts has its own\\nbehaviours, moods, thoughts, memories, and way of understanding the world\\nThat sometimes you don’t recognize yourself\\nYou experience thoughts or feelings that do not seem to be you\\nBig gaps in your memory, such as:\\nForgetting what you did the day before?\\nForgetting your childhood memories?\\nFinding evidence of things that you don’t remember doing, e.g. ﬁnding new items that you don’t remember\\nbuying; ﬁnding notes that you don’t remember writing; meeting people who seem to know you, but you\\ndon’t seem to know them?\\nNormal Dissociation\\nIt is normal for many people to have experienced dissociation at some point in their lives.\\n \\nFor example, people can dissociate or space out:\\nDuring a long, boring drive, and then not really remember how they got somewhere;\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID).pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

When severe enough, the frequent dissociation prevents the person from\\ndeveloping a stable sense of self, which later becomes dissociative identity disorder (DID).\\n \\nDID was formerly known as multiple personality disorder (MPD). We now understand however, that aﬀected\\nindividuals do not have multiple personalities, but rather they have the lack of a single, stable sense of self.\\n \\nClassic symptoms of dissociative identity disorder (DID) include the following:\\nDissociation, which is a mental process where individuals are not fully connected with their thoughts,\\nfeelings, behaviours or memories;\\nSwitching to diﬀerent “alters”, which are alternate identities or personality states. It can feel like you have\\ndiﬀerent persons living in your head. There is usually a main part or “host”, along with at least one other\\npart.\\nAmnesia (loss of time, or ‘blackouts’), whereby the person can’t remember periods of time, or even portions\\nof their childhood.\\nEach identity can have its own name and unique diﬀerences in voice, gender, mannerisms. Some identities\\nmay even require diﬀerent prescription glasses.\\nAt least two of these identities or personality states recurrently take control of the person's behavior.\\nDistress or troubles functioning due to having the condition.\\nOther symptoms include:\\nDerealization, which is the feeling that the world is not real or in a haze.\\nDepersonalization, which is the feeling of being detached from your body, as in an “out of body” experience\\nSwitching to diﬀerent alters, which may appear as sudden changes in mood, behaviour or personality\\n \\nDissociative identity disorder is:\\nNOT due to the direct eﬀects of drug or alcohol use, i.e. not due to blackouts or behaviour during alcohol\\nintoxication.\\nNOT due to a medical condition such as a seizure disorder.\\nNOT a child having imaginary friends.\\nAssociated Symptoms and Conditions\\nDissociative identity disorder (DID) is a complex condition usually takes a very long time before it is properly\\ndiagnosed.\\n \\nMany times, before they end up receiving a DID diagnosis, people with DID are ﬁrst diagnosed with other\\nconditions such as: .\\nDepression, which is problems with extremely low or sad mood\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID).pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Modern neuroscience is starting to conﬁrm what most drummers already\\nknow intuitively -- that drumming is good for the brain. Drumming and the ability to synchronize\\nto a beat builds the brain’s capacity for focused attention, impulse control, self-regulation and\\nother essential higher brain skills.\\nIntroduction\\nInterestingly, most (if not all) human societies have societal practices such as drumming, singing or dancing to a\\nbeat.\\nIn indigenous society, drums are sacred, representing the heartbeat of people, animals and Mother Earth herself.\\nMany of us may still be able to remember how we sang, dance or clapped in preschool or kindergarten.\\nModern understanding of neuroscience is now conﬁrming what many people intuitively know. That there are brain\\nbeneﬁts from many of these traditional activities.\\nSinging, dancing and clapping in synchrony with others is not simply fun. Such rhythmic movement activities in\\npreschool can support the neurologic basis of self-regulation.\\nUnfortunately, as kids grow older, many stop doing these types of brain-building activities.\\nWhat Does the Brain Science Show?\\nGrowing research shows that drumming interventions may have therapeutic beneﬁts for various brain conditions\\nsuch as Alzheimer’s (Keough, 2017), PTSD (Bensimon, 2005; Lithke, 2019), and autism (Willemin, 2018; Cahart,\\n2022).\\nStudies show that people who drum have improved impulse control (Slater, 2017).\\nFor students with ADHD, drumming has been proposed as a type of music intervention in the classroom (Frantz,\\n2020). Studies have shown that people with ADHD do have more diﬃculties sustaining a rhythm with others\\nbecause they have a rhythm cut-oﬀ that is faster than those without ADHD (Gilden, 2009). Treatments such as\\ninteractive metronome (IM) are theorized to help ADHD by improving this sense of timing (Shaﬀer, 2001).', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Drumming for Brain and Mental Health Conditions.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Page 2 / 3\\nFor teenagers with autism, a recent study shows that drumming may help improve socialization skills, inhibition\\ncontrol and focus (Cahart, 2022). Half of 36 people with ASD received a drumming intervention of 8 weeks of\\ndrumming lessons, twice per week, whereas the control group did not. In the drumming group, there were\\nimprovements in ADHD symptoms, social skills and self-regulation. Brain changes were conﬁrmed on fMRI scan,\\nshowing improved connectivity in areas responsible for inhibitory control, action outcomes monitoring and self-\\nregulation.\\nDrumming has the potential to beneﬁt anyone wanting to improve their attention skills, impulse control and self-\\nregulation.\\nHow Does Drumming Help the Brain?\\nDrumming requires beat synchronization, the ability to tap or move to a beat. This requires various skills such as\\nAttention skills (i.e. listening to the beat)\\nMotor skills and hand-eye coordination (i.e. moving to the beat).\\nSense of timing;\\nAbility to monitor and correct mistakes.\\nDrumming with another person requires listening to another and responding to another person (i.e. requiring a\\nsense of empathy).\\nAll of the above foundational lower-level skills are important for higher-level skills such as self-regulation, social\\nskills and well-being (Cahart, 2022).\\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\\nQ. My loved one doesn’t have the coordination to hold drum sticks.\\nA. The drumming instruction will adapt the drumming to your child’s skill level. For example, one could start with\\ndrums played by the hands, which is less complicated than holding drum sticks.\\nQ. I like quiet, and I’m afraid it would get too loud in our home with drums.\\nA. If you decide to get drums for home, there are many quiet options, such as getting a simple drum pad (a rubber\\npad) or electronic drums (where you wear headphones). And you can encourage drumming outside, which will\\nprovide nature beneﬁt as well. \\nQ. My loved one is sensitive to noise.\\nA. The drumming instructor can ﬁnd a quieter type of drum to start with. And because your child will have a sense\\nof control by being the one making the sounds, they will be better able to tolerate the sound.\\nWhere to Find Drumming?\\nDo a search for “therapeutic drumming” in your area, and/or\\nLook for drumming instructors in your area.\\nTo duplicate what was done in Cahart's clinical trials, aim for two drumming lessons per week, at least 45-\\nmin. In length.\\nTherapy Based on Similar Principles\\nIt is interesting to note that there are other types of therapeutic interventions and treatments oﬀered by\\nprofessionals that appear to harness similar principles of timing and beat synchrony.\\nInteractive Metronome (IM)\\nInteractive metronome is a type of therapy where with the help of computer equipment, a person (with the help of\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Drumming for Brain and Mental Health Conditions.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Anorexia (anorexia nervosa) is a\\ncondition where individuals eat so little that they become malnourished. Symptoms may include\\nloss of menstrual periods, feeling cold, or troubles with mood or thinking. Bulimia is a condition\\nwhere individuals maintain a somewhat normal weight, but have problems with binging (eating\\nlarge quantities of food at once) and/or purging (making themselves throw up or vomit). The\\ngood news, is that there eﬀective ways to support and help individuals with eating disorders.\\nIntroduction\\nEveryone has times when they don't eat normally; sometimes we eat less, sometimes we eat more. But when a\\nperson has such extremes of eating that it causes problems, it may be an eating disorder.\\n \\nThese extremes may range from purposely starving oneself and trying to not eat in order to lose weight, to the\\nopposite extreme of binging or overeating. At either extreme, there are usually feelings of extreme distress or\\nconcern about body weight or shape.\\n \\nA person with an eating disorder may have started out just eating smaller or larger amounts of food than usual, but\\nat some point, the urge to eat less or more spirals out of control.\\n \\nThe main types of eating disorders are:\\nAnorexia, marked by fears of gaining weight that leads to severe under-eating, which leads to starvation\\nand undernutrition.\\nBulimia, marked by binge eating followed by purging (e.g. self-induced vomiting, or excessive exercise).\\nEating Disorder NOS\\nWhen Do Eating Disorders Appear?\\nEating disorders frequently appear during adolescence or young adulthood, but some reports indicate that they\\ncan develop during childhood or later in adulthood.

People with eating disorders also can suﬀer from numerous other physical health complications,\\nsuch as heart conditions or kidney failure, which can lead to death.\\nTreatments for Eating Disorders\\nDespite the severity of eating disorders, they are nonetheless treatable conditions. Treatment plans are tailored to\\nthe person's individual needs and may include:\\nMedical care and monitoring of the patient's weight\\nMedications\\nNutrition counselling\\nIndividual, group and/or family psychotherapy.\\nSome patients may also need to be hospitalized to treat malnutrition or to gain weight, or for other reasons.\\nAnorexia Nervosa\\nAnorexia nervosa is marked by a severe pursuit of thinness and refusal to eat and maintain a healthy weight.\\nPeople with anorexia nervosa will usually try to lose weight through avoiding eating, but may also use other\\nstrategies such as exercising excessively; making themselves vomit, or misusing laxatives, diuretics or enemas.\\n \\nMany people with anorexia see themselves as overweight, even when they are starved or are clearly\\nmalnourished. Eating, food and weight control become obsessions. A person with anorexia typically weighs herself\\nor himself repeatedly, portions food carefully, and eats only very small quantities of only certain foods. Some who\\nhave anorexia recover with treatment after only one episode. Others get well but have relapses. Still others have a\\nmore chronic form of anorexia, in which their health deteriorates over many years as they battle the illness.\\n \\nAnorexia is a serious illness. According to some studies, people with anorexia are up to ten times more likely to die\\nas a result of their illness compared to those without the disorder. The most common complications that lead to\\ndeath are cardiac arrest, and electrolyte and ﬂuid imbalances.

Anorexia (anorexia nervosa) is a\\ncondition where individuals eat so little that they become malnourished. Symptoms may include\\nloss of menstrual periods, feeling cold, or troubles with mood or thinking. Bulimia is a condition\\nwhere individuals maintain a somewhat normal weight, but have problems with binging (eating\\nlarge quantities of food at once) and/or purging (making themselves throw up or vomit). The\\ngood news, is that there are many eﬀective ways to support and help individuals with eating\\ndisorders.\\nWhat are Eating Disorders?\\nEating disorders are a group of potentially fatal conditions where people experience severe problems with their\\neating, which aﬀect them physically and emotionally.\\n \\nThings may start oﬀ as a diet, where your child is doing something to try and feel better about him or herself. \\nFrom there, however, it can quickly escalate into a dangerous, life threatening eating disorder.\\n \\nOn the outside, you may notice the visible signs of an eating disorder in your child, such as not eating, binge-\\neating on food, vomiting, or being obsessed with how his or her body looks.  On the inside, your child may be\\nhaunted with overwhelming thoughts of worthlessness, self-hatred, and feeling \"not good enough\". \\n \\nOnce the illness takes hold of your child, it is very diﬃcult for them to stop the eating disorder behaviours. Eating\\ndisorders rob the person of their judgement and force the person to become obsessed with food. Starvation can\\nlead to all types of mood problems, including tremendous sadness, irritability and anger. Despite these terrible\\nfeelings however, the person feels compelled to continue these behaviours in the desperate hope that eventually\\ns/he will feel better on the inside.\\n \\nThe main types of Eating Disorders are:\\n \\n1. Anorexia Nervosa\\n \\nAnorexia nervosa is when a person restricts eating so much that the person loses a signiﬁcant amount of weight\\n(or in a child, when they stop growing). The severe food restriction is frequently accompanied by excessive', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Eating Disorders in Children and Youth_ Guide for Parents and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 6\\nexercise.\\n \\nYou may also notice changes in personality such as becoming more focused or obsessed with school work, being\\nmore irritable, and isolating oneself from friends and family. \\n \\nAnorexia nervosa aﬀects up to 1% of adolescent girls.  It also occurs in boys and in younger children. \\n \\nSometimes a person with anorexia nervosa can switch to having bulimia nervosa over time. However, since this\\npattern takes years to develop, it is more commonly seen in adults rather than youth.\\n \\n2. Bulimia nervosa\\n \\nBulimia nervosa is characterized by cycles of binge-eating and purging. A cycle usually starts when a person goes\\non a signiﬁcant diet and restricts their food intake.  The body responds by driving the person to binge eat a large\\namount of food in a single sitting.  This often leaves the person feeling very ashamed and anxious and needing to\\ncompensate by vomiting, exercising, skipping meals, using laxatives, or diuretic pills.\\n \\nSimilar to anorexia nervosa, a person with bulimia nervosa may become very irritable and distant.  Unlike people\\nwith anorexia nervosa, however, people with bulimia may not have any signiﬁcant weight loss.\\n \\nBulimia Nervosa aﬀects up to 4% of teenage girls, and normally develops later than anorexia nervosa. Bulimia\\nnervosa can also aﬀect adolescent boys.\\n \\n3. Eating Disorder NOS (Not Otherwise Speciﬁed)\\n \\nEating Disorder NOS  is diagnosed when a person has a serious eating disorder, but the condition does not meet the\\nformal criteria for anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. This is a frequent diagnosis for children and youth. \\n \\n4. Binge Eating Disorder (BED)\\n \\nBinge Eating Disorder is a new diagnosis for children and youth.  It occurs when a person is driven to binge eat,\\nwithout making themselves compensate afterwards (by vomiting or skipping meals for example). \\n \\nFood seeking is frequently caused by diﬃcult emotions that the child does not know how to handle.  They also\\nexperience a lack of control when overeating.  People with BED are often overweight or obese.\\nWhat are the Warning Signs of an Eating Disorder?\\nThe following are warning signs  that an eating disorder may be present or developing:\\nUnexplained weight loss\\nFear of gaining weight\\nDieting behaviour\\nIncreased picky eating, especially eating only \"healthy foods\"\\nHiding food in napkins, or cutting food in tiny pieces\\nAlways going to the bathroom immediately after eating\\nLarge amounts of food missing\\nEvidence of visiting pro anorexia or eating disorder websites\\nThe following are serious signs  of an eating disorder\\nExcessive weight loss\\nFasting and skipping meals on a regular basis\\nRefusing to eat with the family\\nTwo skipped menstrual periods (in girls)\\nAny binge-eating episodes\\nAny purging episodes', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Eating Disorders in Children and Youth_ Guide for Parents and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Possible inﬂuences are:\\nbeing frightened by changes during puberty,\\npeer pressure to look and act a certain way,\\nfamily history of an eating disorder,\\npersonality traits such as perfectionism and low self-esteem,\\ncultural inﬂuences and societal pressure focused on having a thin body ideal.\\nAt one time, families were blamed for causing eating disorders. This is simply not true. Although there are family\\nsituations that can cause stress to the family (as well as your child), it is unlikely that any one situation actually\\ncaused the eating disorder. \\n \\nIn fact, families are an important part of the solution.  Families play a major role in supporting and assisting their\\nchild to recover from an eating disorder.\\nWhat are the Consequences of an Eating Disorder?\\nPhysical: \\nCold intolerance (the person feels cold all of the time)\\nLoss of hair\\nLoss of menstruation in young women\\nOsteoporosis (extreme thinning of the bones), broken bones\\nDecreased blood pressure / decreased heart rate\\nDecreased size of heart which can lead to heart failure or death.\\nHeart arrhythmias (irregular heart beat)\\nStomach ulcers\\nStunted growth\\nDehydration\\nBreakdown of tooth enamel\\nPsychological:\\nPoor memory and concentration\\nIrritability or severe mood ﬂuctuations\\nPerfectionism (e.g. spending excessive time on school work)\\nAnxiety\\nSadness / Depression\\nDiﬃculty sleeping\\nCrying spells\\nLoss of interest in regular activities', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Eating Disorders in Children and Youth_ Guide for Parents and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

The doctor may recommend more specialized mental health services, or help with referrals to\\nmental health professionals such as a psychologist, or psychiatrist.\\n \\nBecome as educated as you can. Eating disorders are challenging illnesses that often appear to defy logic, and can\\ncause great anguish and distress at home.  Arm yourself with the knowledge that this is not a phase. Your child\\ncannot help the way s/he is acting, nor can s/he get over the eating disorder on their own.  They will need your\\nhelp and support, as well as the support of professionals.\\nHow Are Eating Disorders Treated?\\nBecause these are diﬃcult and complicated disorders, it often takes a team of professionals, working together, to\\ntreat an eating disorder.  Team members may include physicians (such as family doctors, paediatricians or\\npsychiatrists) , therapists (such as psychologists, or social workers), dietitians, and of course, the family.\\n \\nParents and/or caregivers are an essential part of treatment.  As you would support your child through any other\\nserious medical conditions (such as diabetes or cancer) your child needs your constant support to recover from an\\neating disorder.  \\n \\nTypical Treatments\\nIndividual Counselling/therapy  helps a person to learn more about eating disorders, and examine some\\nof the diﬃcult feelings that lie underneath. They will work on improving their self-esteem and developing\\nnew coping strategies. Therapy or counselling also helps a child to become motivated over  time to recover\\nfrom an eating disorder.\\nFamily therapy  focuses on education about eating disorders, and helping parents develop the tools and\\nstrategies needed to support their child's recovery. Once the eating disorder behaviours have improved,\\nfamily work may also focus on reducing any other stress in the family, and on adolescent issues in general.\\nMedications  can be used to help reduce binge-eating and purging in bulimia nervosa. There are no\\nmedications proven to treat anorexia nervosa. Medications, however, may be looked at to treat\\noverwhelming anxiety and depression, or when a patient is very stuck and not getting better with other\\nsupports.\\nHospitalization may be required if a patient is medically unwell, and needs intensive care and monitoring.\\nHospitalization can also be helpful when a person is not getting better outside of the hospital despite\\nsupport from their family and professionals.\\nHow To Help Your Child with an Eating Disorder\\nDo's\\nDo get help and support immediately, even if your child is refusing any help or support.\\nDo let your child know that you are concerned , and you are going to get them help.\\nDo tell your child  that you want to hear  what s/he has to say, and want to know how they are feeling\\ninside.\\nDo understand that your child is feeling awful about him or herself  and is overwhelmed by self-\\ncriticism.

Quite the contrary. It\\'s your child\\'s way\\nof trying to feel better.\\nDon\\'t think of your child\\'s refusal to eat as \"bad behaviour\" . Your child is stuck in a pattern of doing\\nwhat s/he thinks will make things better. In addition, starvation dramatically alters a person\\'s mood and\\nbehaviour.\\nDon\\'t spend endless time trying to ﬁgure out \"why has this happened\".  There does not have to be\\nan underlying problem or secret at the root. Devote your energy to getting your child help and being a\\nsupport.\\nDon\\'t make comments or have conversations focused on weight or appearance, in front of your\\nchild. Even if you are giving compliments to your child about his/her appearance, this can reinforce the\\nimportance of appearance and weight.\\nFrequently Asked Questions\\n1. Will my child just grow out of this?\\n \\nOnce a diagnosis of an actual eating disorder has been reached, your child will need a team of professionals\\nto help overcome the illness. This is long and hard work.  Eating disorders rarely just go away on their own.  \\n \\n2. What has happened to my child\\'s personality? How did my child go from being so sensitive to being dishonest,\\nangry and secretive?\\n \\nYou may have noticed many changes in your child\\'s personality.  These are the eﬀects of starvation and the\\nEating Disorder itself.  Most likely, however, underneath this appearance, your child is very upset about how\\nthey are acting, and is unable to help themselves.\\nSummary\\nEating disorders are a potentially life threatening condition where an individual\\'s eating patterns become severely\\ndisrupted.\\n \\nThe good news is that help and support exists both for families and the individual with an eating disorder.\\nRecommended Readings and References\\nHerzog, D., Franko, D. & Cable, P.

On the other hand, for\\nsome people, the fear of vomiting (emetophobia) is so overwhelming that it ends up controlling\\ntheir life. In order to avoid situations where there is the slightest possibility of vomiting, people\\ncan avoid going out, ending up housebound.

You are\\nyour child’s ﬁrst and most important teacher. A loving relationship with your child is the best way you can help\\nthem learn to deal with diﬃcult feelings.\\nUnpleasant Feelings that Your Child May Have\\nAnger\\n \\nAnger is a common feeling, and temper tantrums are normal in young children. They are your child’s way of letting\\nyou know that they feel angry, upset or frustrated. Try to ﬁnd out what is bothering your child and respond\\ndiﬀerently depending on what is wrong.  \\nIf your child is hitting another child, we can validate their frustration and teach them how to express their\\nfrustration in other ways without hitting. \\nIf your child is tired or sick, hold and comfort your child.\\nIf your child is asking for something they should not have, do not give in, even if your child gets angry. Your\\nchild needs to learn that there are some things they cannot have.\\nBeing ﬁrm and loving is important. Yelling, screaming, nagging, or hitting can harm your child. \\nHere are some healthier suggestions to help your child:  \\nBend or sit down so that you talk directly to your child.\\nTell your child calmly that you understand that they are angry (upset) and need to calm down.\\nYour child may need a short time alone to calm down. Some people call this “time-out.” Do not use this to\\npunish your child. Make sure your child does not think you are leaving. Say that you will stay close to make\\nsure everything is OK. Your child needs to understand that this is a chance to calm down and learn control.\\nYou, too, may need this time to calm down.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Emotions_ Helping Young Children Cope with Emotions.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 3\\nGive positive feedback when your child is calmer, e.g. \"I am so glad you are feeling better.\"\\nHelp your child learn the words for feelings so that they can talk about them. \\nFears and Worries\\n \\nFears and worries are also common. Your child may be afraid of monsters, of the dark, or new situations.\\n \\nIt is important to accept your child’s fears. Do not tease or get angry. Keep calm. Try to get your child to talk about\\nwhat is bothering them. And suggest things to say or do when they are afraid.\\n \\nSadness\\n \\nAdults can ﬁnd it hard to believe that young children get sad. But they do. The same things that make you sad can\\nmake your child sad. It is normal for your child to be sad when a pet dies or a toy disappears.\\nTry to ﬁnd out what is making your child sad and get them to talk about it. Give your child a little more attention\\nand cuddling to help them become interested in things again.\\nJealousy\\n \\nBeing jealous is normal. Your young child will ﬁnd it hard to share toys with others. And they will not like sharing\\nyour attention. For example, your child may get demanding when you talk to other people on the telephone or\\nwhen a new baby is in the family.\\nWhen this happens, calmly tell your child that you understand they would like your attention right now, but you are\\nbusy. Get your child to do something close to you, and say that you will be with them soon.\\nThink about how you would like to be helped when you are upset. Chances are your child wants the same kind of\\nhelp.\\nWhen you get angry with your child, you can help your child by:\\nsaying that you are sorry for getting angry\\nexplaining what is making you angry\\nShowing how you deal with your own anger by calming yourself, for example, by breathing deeply and\\ncounting slowly to 10. Your child will learn from your example.\\n \\nMost of all, your child needs to feel that you are calm and are not getting caught up in their strong feelings. No one\\nexpects you to be perfect. Try to understand your child; each child is diﬀerent, and your child may be easy or\\ndiﬃcult to get along with. Calmly make sure that your child understands which behaviours are unacceptable and\\nhelp them deal with feelings that might be causing the behaviour.\\n \\nHow you respond to your child most of the time is what matters. Tell your child when they do something well. Your\\nchild loves you and wants to please you more than anything. Remember that you are the most important teacher\\nyour child will ever have.\\nHow You May Feel\\nWhen your child expresses strong feelings, sometimes you might get almost as angry or upset as your child. You\\nmay not have as much patience as you would like. You might feel helpless and not know what to do, or you might\\nfeel that you can’t take your child’s crying or whining anymore. It isn’t easy being a parent. Try to tell yourself that\\nthe situation is not worth getting upset about or talk things over with a friend or another parent who has a child\\nabout the same age as yours.\\n \\nBefore you respond, try to put yourself in your child’s place. Would you like to be yelled at in public or at home?

Encopresis)?\\nSoiling (also known as encopresis) is when a toilet-trained child has bowel movements in places other than the\\ntoilet (for example, in their underwear or while sleeping) when they lose bowel control. Constipation is by far the\\nmost common cause of encopresis in children.\\nHow Does Soiling (Encopresis) Happen?\\nChildren often put oﬀ going for a bowel movement or resist the urge to poop when they are stressed about toilet\\ntraining or simply busy playing. Over time, this can lead to stool becoming hard, dry, and diﬃcult to pass. By this\\npoint, constipation makes bowel movements hurt, and your child will resist the urge even more. The bowels will\\nbecome larger than normal, making it harder for the bowel muscles to work properly. Then, a large stool mass can\\nbuild up in the rectum (the part of the bowel that holds stool) – this is known as fecal impaction. Stool builds up\\nbehind this impaction and may leak, leading to soiling.\\nHow Does Constipation Happen?\\nMany factors can lead to constipation:\\nNot eating enough ﬁbre, found in fruits, vegetables, and grains\\nNot getting enough physical activity\\nCertain medications\\nHolding in stool and putting oﬀ the urge to poop; this often happens when starting potty training and with\\nstarting school\\nWhat Are The Symptoms?\\nA child with constipation may have any of the following:\\nStool that is hard or painful to pass\\nVery large bowel movements', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Encopresis (aka Soiling)_ Information for Parents and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

It will take just as long for constipation to improve. The bowel will return to a normal size if the stool\\ndoesn’t build up over the next 3-6 months.  \\nChildren usually need non-prescription medications like laxatives and stool softeners for a few months to resolve\\nconstipation.  Some may need medication to empty or “clean out” the bowel of a large amount of stool.\\nWhat Can We Do?\\nYour health care provider may prescribe you medications to help resolve constipation, but there are many other\\nsteps you can do to help resolve constipation and prevent it from returning.\\nHealthy diet1.\\nVegetables, fruits, legumes and whole grains (e.g. bread, pasta, crackers and cereal) are good\\nsources of ﬁbre. Try to include these in each meal and snack. \\nThe amount of ﬁbre needed each day depends on your child’s age. Check Canada’s Food Guide for\\nthe number of servings your child should have daily.\\nFibre should be increased gradually in your child’s diet.\\nTry to modify some of your frequent meals or recipes to increase the ﬁbre content. For example,\\nusing whole wheat instead of white ﬂour or adding bran, ﬂaxseed or wheat germ to casseroles and\\npasta sauces.\\nTake a look at labels and compare their % daily ﬁbre value. This will help you choose products that\\nare good sources of ﬁbre.\\nIncrease ﬂuids2.\\nIncrease ﬂuid intake. Toddlers should drink 2-3 cups of milk daily; the rest should come from water.\\nLimit juice intake to ½-1 cup per day. It can cause cramping and gas!\\nRecommended ﬂuid intake depends on your child’s weight:\\nA 10 kg (22 lb) child needs 1 litre or 4 cups each day\\nA 20 kg (44 lb) child needs 1.5 litres or 6 cups each day\\nA 45 kg (99 lb) child needs 2 litres or 8 cups each day\\nRegular toileting1.\\nTraining the bowel back to a normal pattern can take weeks or months. A good way to work towards\\nthis is to take advantage of the body’s normal reﬂex (or urge) to empty after meals.\\n20-30 minutes after each meal, have your child sit on the toilet or potty for 1 minute each year of age\\n(e.g. 3 minutes for a 3-year-old). Take this time to read a book, chat, and catch up!\\nDepending on your child’s age, rewards such as sticker charts may help encourage this time sitting\\non the toilet.\\nKeep a diary of how often your child has a bowel movement, the type of stool he/she is having, and\\nany symptoms listed above.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Encopresis (aka Soiling)_ Information for Parents and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

The eﬀects of FASD typically\\ninclude physical, mental, and learning disabilities as well as behavioral deﬁcits and problems\\nwith socialization.\\nAbout the Disorder\\nFetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is an umbrella term that describes a wide range of eﬀects that can occur\\nin a child whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause signiﬁcant brain\\ndamage. The eﬀects of FASD typically include physical, mental, and learning disabilities as well as behavioral\\ndeﬁcits and problems with socialization.\\n \\nFASD includes the following categories:\\nFetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)—This is indicated by a pattern of neurological, behavioral, and cognitive\\ndeﬁcits along with speciﬁc facial features.\\nAlcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND)— This term is used when only central nervous system\\nabnormalities are present as a result of the fetal alcohol exposure. ARND is characterized by problems with\\nmemory and motor skills.\\nAlcohol-related birth defects (ARBD)—This is indicated by defects in the growth of skeletal and major organ\\nsystems.\\nFetal alcohol eﬀects (FAE)—This term is sometimes used to describe children who had prenatal exposure to\\nalcohol but do not have all the symptoms (particularly the facial features) associated with FAS.\\nSome children will have no physical symptoms of FAS. If it is certain that a child was exposed to alcohol before\\nbirth but there are no physical symptoms and the child’s early childhood screening appears to be within normal\\ndevelopment, a followup screening may be necessary when the child is older if behavioral or learning deﬁcits\\nbecome apparent.\\nWhat You May See\\nAn infant with FASD may be very irritable, fussy, and/or cry a lot for no apparent reason. As a child with FASD\\ngrows, parents and caregivers may begin to notice that the child’s development of gross motor skills is\\ndelayed—for example the child may walk or run with an awkward gait, have diﬃculty tossing and catching a ball,\\nand/or struggle to be able to hop on one foot. The child may also exhibit cognitive deﬁcits—for example the child\\nmay have trouble problem solving, diﬃculty planning future actions, and problems taking in, storing, and recalling\\ninformation. Because of damage to the brain, a child with FASD is sometimes overly sensitive to sensory input—for\\nexample they may be upset by bright lights, loud noises, and tags on their clothes.\\n \\nAs the child’s development continues, parents and caregivers may notice that the child has verbal skills that\\nexceed their level of understanding, which will sometimes lead a child to say they understand something when\\nthey don’t. They are also likely to have diﬃculty following multiple directions. These challenges are frustrating and\\ncan lead the child to emotional outbursts. Along with auditory processing problems, parents may also see a child', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD).pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

It is also typical for children with FASD to miss social cues and\\nbe unable to entertain themselves.

Avoid words with double meanings, sarcasm, and irony.\\nGive only one-step or two-step directions.\\nSimplify the child’s environment and take steps to avoid sensory triggers.\\nBe consistent and structure the day so there are predictable routines.\\nRepeat and re-teach frequently. Rules, expectations, and directions may not be remembered from day to\\nday. Review behavioral expectations with the child before each event.\\nUse pictures, charts, and demonstrations. Allow children to ﬁnd their own way of performing a task when\\npossible.\\nProvide skills training and use a lot of role playing.\\nSupervise all activities—children with FASD can be socially naïve and are easily victimized.\\nUse direct teaching of skills that are missing. Materials similar to those designed for students with autism\\nare often helpful in teaching behaviors like social interactions, waiting in line, and asking for help.\\nUse teaching strategies that focus on the child’s strengths; whenever possible give the child jobs to do that\\nrequire the child’s strengths.\\nDocumenting Your Concerns and Next Steps\\nWhen documenting behavior, avoid generalizations such as “Roberto never remembers the rules for circle time.”\\nInstead, provide observations such as “Each day this week I have had to remind Roberto that when another child is\\nspeaking during circle time he must raise his hand and wait until the other child is done.” Often it helps to write out', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD).pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Food cravings can pose a serious health\\nproblem, as they can lead us to eat large amounts of unhealthy foods, thus contributing to\\nproblems with weight. The good news is that there are many strategies that can be done to help\\ndeal with food cravings.\\nWhat are Food Cravings?\\nHuman beings need to eat in order to live, and as a result, our body signals through cravings and urges that we\\nneed to eat.  For most of human history, humans spent most of their days moving outside, and would expend large\\namounts of energy in hunting and gathering. Our traditional diet was high in natural grains, vegetables, fruits and\\nlower amounts of meat.\\nFood cravings helped hunter gatherers survive:\\nCravings for sweet foods were a signal that a ripe fruit was ready to be eaten;\\nCravings for salty foods helped ensure we had enough salt in our diet; for most of human history, salt was\\nextremely hard to ﬁnd and thus extremely valuable and sought after.\\nCravings for fatty or carb rich foods helped ensure we got enough calories. Hunting and gathering requires\\nmany calories, as hunter gatherers travel a distance of 6-16 km daily.\\nIn modern times however, we live under much diﬀerent circumstances than those which we evolved under. Our\\nmodern lifestyle is largely spent indoors, much of it sitting in front of a screen. Our modern diet is rich with\\nprocessed foods that are calorie rich, and high in fat, sugar and salt, all of which trigger our brains to want more.\\nModern foods in fact have been speciﬁcally designed by food scientists to be addictive, because the more we eat,\\nthe more we buy, and the more the food industry proﬁts.\\nThis helps explain why 30% of children/youth (aged 5-17) are overweight or obese, and why 64% of adult\\nCanadians are overweight or obese (Public Health Canada, 2019). In the USA, 72% of adults are overweight or\\nobese (CDC, 2018).\\nSelf-Help Strategies\\nDo's\\nDo try the following preventive strategies to help prevent having cravings in the ﬁrst place:\\nGet enough sleep .

Most North American\\nteens are unfortunately not getting enough sleep.\\nDeal with stress.  What stresses are you under at home, work, school or relationships? Try to come up with\\na plan to deal and cope with each stress. Being stressed out increases cravings.\\nAre you experiencing a craving? Try these strategies.\\nDrink a large glass of water and wait for a few minutes . If the craving goes away, you were probably\\njust thirsty. When the body is thirsty, it can trigger a craving. In one study, drinking an extra 1.5 L of water a\\nday was shown to help overweight female subjects to eat less, and lose weight (Vij, 2014).\\nTake a brisk walk for 15-minutes . Research shows that when people have food cravings such as for\\nchocolate, physical exercise can reduce the craving (Ledochowski, 2015).\\nDistraction.  Take a break from what you are doing and do something diﬀerent.\\nChew something, such as sugar-free gum, or something else . Chewing has been shown in numerous\\nstudies to lower appetite and cravings for food (Miguel-Kergoat, 2015).\\nAsk yourself:\\nAm I bored? If so, then do something to help with your boredom, e.g. listen to some music; talk to\\nsomeone; read a book; play a video game, etc.\\nAm I stressed? If so, then do something to deal with your stress. Do something to relax, e.g. take a\\nnap, go for a walk or sit outside, call up a friend or loved one to chat; meditate; listen to relaxation\\nmusic, etc.\\nAvoid drops in your blood sugar. \\nYou may be getting cravings because you are actually hungry, or your blood sugar is low.\\nIf so, then ensure that you are eating a healthy diet, in order to avoid sudden drops in blood sugar.\\nFor example, a diet high in processed carbohydrates and sweets (e.g. eating white bread and chips\\nfor lunch) will give you a sugar high, but then you may experience cravings when your blood sugar\\ndrops later on.\\nInstead, eat meals that are similar to what someone with diabetes might eat, in order to have more\\ngradual increases in blood glucose, and avoid sudden drops.\\nFor example, eat\\nMeals with complex carbohydrates, such as whole grain carbohydrates that are high in ﬁber\\n(as opposed to white bread, or processed carbs).\\nIncrease healthy dietary protein to 25% of your diet. One study showed that increasing dietary\\nprotein helped weight loss in overweight males (Leidy, 2012).\\nStill having cravings?\\nHave healthier snacks on hand such as:\\nNuts.\\nFresh fruits and vegetables. Fresh fruits and vegetables have ﬁber, which is ﬁlling.\\nLow sugar yogurt. Note that for many people, high fat yogurt is actually a good thing, as it helps\\ntrigger satiety, i.e. tells your body that you have eaten enough.\\nCheese\\nHummus.\\nAir popped popcorn.\\nFor more examples of healthy snacks, see “Healthy Snacks for Adults” (Health Link BC)\\nhttps://www.healthlinkbc.ca/healthlinkbc-ﬁles/healthy-snacks-adults\\nDon'ts \\nDon’t keep tempting foods in the home .

Diet sodas are marketed as being low in calories, which would thus make it seem\\nthat they are a healthy choice. Unfortunate, studies show that drinking diet soda actually increases weight\\ngain. It is believed that the artiﬁcial sweeteners in diet drinks are bad because 1) they still encourage your\\nbody to produce insulin, which makes your body store calories from other foods you have eaten; 2) it\\nconditions your taste buds for sweetness, and 3) you become entitled to eat more (Zetlin, 2018).\\nAre You Still Struggling with Food Cravings?\\nSee a health professional such as a family physician, paediatrician if you are still struggling with food cravings.\\nThey can help ensure that there aren't any medical issues contributing.

Unfortunately, those who are gay, lesbian or bisexual often face signiﬁcant\\ndiscrimination, which may lead to stress and contribute to mental health problems. As society\\nand as individuals, there must be acceptance no matter what one\\'s sexual orientation.\\nIntroduction\\nPerhaps you have always wondered whether or not your child might be gay, lesbian or bisexual. Or perhaps your\\nchild has just ‘come out of the closet\\', and has said that she or he is gay. (Gay, by the way, can refer to a male\\ninterested in males, but it can also mean a female interested in females.)\\n \\nTypical Parent Responses\\n \\nDealing with the possibility that your child is gay, or might be gay, can be an extremely stressful time for many\\nparents and families. Some of the possible reactions that families may have are:\\nDenial: \"No, he can\\'t be gay. He\\'s had girlfriends before!\" or \"No, she can\\'t be gay/lesbian. She had a\\nboyfriend just last month!\"\\nAnger: some parents may act with anger. \"How can he do this to us?\" It may be tempting to express your\\nanger towards your child with hostility or rejection; in the end, anger is not helpful.\\nGuilt: \"Was it something we did as parents?\"\\nBargaining: \"If only s/he isn\\'t gay, then we\\'ll get her whatever s/he wants...\"\\nAcceptance: \"As much as this has been tough on me as a parent, I know it can\\'t be easy for my child either.\\nIn the end, the most important thing is that we give him/her our love and support.\\nRegardless of how you feel about gays, lesbians or homosexuality, the bottom line is that your child needs your\\nlove and support.\\n \\nThere is nothing wrong in being gay, lesbian or bisexual, nor is it a mental health problem. The only thing that is\\nwrong is the stigma and discrimination that people who are gay, lesbian or bisexual must face.\\nFacts and Myths about Being Gay\\nMyth: People choose to be gay. \\nFact: A person doesn\\'t choose to be gay any more than a straight person chooses to be straight. In fact, there is', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Issues (Children and Youth).pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 3\\nevidence that suggests that sexual orientation is determined before birth or early in life, and that it may be\\ngenetically determined. In other words, it may be determined by genes passed on from the parents. Ultimately,\\nworrying about why someone is gay isn\\'t the most important issue. After all, would you worry about why someone\\nis straight? What is important is that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.\\n \\nMyth: Gay people sleep around, and get AIDS/HIV.\\nFact: Being gay doesn\\'t mean that your child is promiscuous, any more than being straight does. Most of the\\npeople in the world with AIDS/HIV are straight, not gay.\\n \\nMyth: People who are gay are pedophiles.\\nFact: The empirical research does not show that gay or bisexual men are any more likely than heterosexual men\\nto molest children (Harek, 2007; Jenny, 1994).\\n \\nMyth: My child will never get married, never have children, and live a lonely life.\\nFact:  This is an old prejudice that is simply no longer the case. Gay couples can get married, have children and\\nhave healthy families. Having a healthy family is about having caring and respectful relationships between family\\nmembers; it has nothing to do with sexual orientation. (American Psychological Association, 2007). \\n \\nTerms\\nBisexual:  being physically and emotionally attracted to people of both the same and opposite sexes.\\n \\nGay:  someone who is physically and emotionally attracted to people of the same sex. Although in the past, gay\\nmainly referred to males, it can include both males and females.\\n \\nLGBT:  an umbrella term used to refer to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, transsexual and\\ntwo-spirited.\\n \\nHeterosexual or straight:  someone who is sexually and emotionally attracted to people of the opposite sex.\\n \\nHomosexual:  being sexually and emotionally attracted to those of one\\'s own sex. Historically, this term has had a\\nnegative connotation, so most people prefer other terms, such as lesbian, gay and bisexual.\\n \\nLesbian:  a woman attracted sexually and emotionally to other women.\\n \\nTransgendered:  a person whose gender identity (self-identiﬁcation as male, female, both or neither) does not\\nmatch his/her \"assigned gender\" (classiﬁcation by others as male or female based on genetic/physical sex). For\\nexample, a person who outwardly looks male, but who really feels like a woman on the inside. Or vice versa, a\\nperson who outwardly looks female, but who really feels like a man on the inside.\\n \\nTranssexual:  a transgendered person who has had treatments to alter the sex of his or her body.\\nKey Advice for Parents and Caregivers\\nAbove all, accept and love your child, who is the same child as before.\\n \\nAcknowledge your loved one\\'s sexuality by talking about it together.  Ignoring it entirely is a rejection. When you\\ntalk about your loved one\\'s sexuality, don\\'t reject them with one through anger or insistence that \"it\\'s only a\\npassing phase.\" Ask questions about that which you don\\'t understand.\\n \\nDon\\'t get upset at your loved one for having told you that s/he is gay and deﬁnitely don\\'t get upset with them for\\nnot telling you earlier.  After all, how would that make your youth feel about talking to you?\\n \\nOﬀer support to your child. You might say \"I love you no matter what. How can I be helpful? How can I be\\nsupportive?\"\\n \\nGet support from others. Talk with others. Talk with other parents of gay or lesbian children.

Respect your child's privacy by checking with\\nhim or her about those with whom it is acceptable to share this personal information.\\n \\nShould I tell the school?  It depends. Would you tell the school if you discovered your child was straight? If your\\nchild wants to tell a supportive teacher, then go ahead.  But if the school or other students are going to be hostile,\\nit may be better to keep silent. Reassure your youth that in the future, it gets easier in more mature environments\\nsuch as college, university or most workplaces.\\n \\nWhat about dating? At some point, your gay teenager may ask to bring home a date. Treat your teenager the\\nsame way you would if it was an opposite-sex date.\\n \\nWhat should I tell my friends and relatives? At some point, you will want to tell relatives and friends. If you\\nyourself are conﬂicted, then wait until you are feeling more okay with it.  Get your child's permission before telling\\nothers, and ask your child what s/he feels comfortable with you telling.  True friends and relatives will be\\nsupportive. For those who are unsupportive, you may need to avoid or spend less time with them. If they are\\ncritical or hostile, you have a right to ask them to avoid making negative comments around you. \\nSummary\\nEveryone deserves to be treated with dignity, love and respect. We are all sexual beings, and struggle with our\\ndrives, desires, orientation, self-identity, loneliness and relationships. We do not choose our orientation. We must\\nlearn to accept and love ourselves (or another), without judging or hurting one another.

But for some, the sex and gender identity don’t match at\\nall. This could mean 1) A child who is born male at birth, feels like a girl on the inside, or 2) A\\nchild who is born female at birth, feels like a boy on the inside, or 3) A child or youth does not\\nidentify completely as either a boy or a girl. If you have just recently learned that your child or\\nteen is questioning gender identity, you might feel quite overwhelmed, upset, and not know\\nwhat to do. Remember that your child or teen may have been very worried about how you would\\nreact. Your child needs your love and reassurance more than ever. Children and youth need to\\nhear that being transgender does not make you love them any less. Transgender children and\\nyouth who are supported have the best chance of growing up to be happy, productive adults.\\nPeople who are loved, supported and allowed to express their true selves, will do far better.\\nIntroduction\\nFor many people, the sex we are born with (designated at birth) is a good match for how we see ourselves on the\\ninside. But for some, the sex and gender identity don’t match at all. This could mean that:\\nA child who is born male at birth, feels like a girl on the inside (i.e. gender assigned male, trans female). \\nA child who is born female at birth, feels like a boy on the inside (i.e. gender assigned female, trans male). \\nA child or youth does not identify completely as either a boy or a girl.\\nGender\\nWhile some people see gender as ‘binary’ (either you’re male or female), others see it very diﬀerently. Another\\nway to think about gender is as a continuum, a scale or a spectrum. A continuum can be helpful because it\\nincludes people whose gender identity doesn’t fall within the boundaries of either male or female.\\n \\nRemember: sexual orientation (whom we’re attracted to) is not the same thing as gender. For example, some trans\\nmen are gay, and attracted to other men. Some trans women are lesbians, and are attracted to other women.\\n \\nSomeone's gender identity can be at any point along the continuum:\\nSeeing yourself as neither male nor female  \\nSeeing yourself as a boy or man\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Gender Identity, Gender Diversity, and Transgender Issues in Children and Youth.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Some people feel a lot of conﬂict, while others feel less. Some people have more diﬃculty with\\nother people’s reactions (social conﬂict) than with any conﬂict they feel inside. Others experience social as well as\\nsevere internal conﬂict.\\n \\nSex:  (or designated sex) is about how we understand our bodies as male or female, including whether we’re born\\nwith a penis or a vulva.\\n \\nGender identity : is the personal feeling of being a man, a woman. Some people don’t identify as being either a\\nman or a woman. They may feel that this ‘either/or’ system doesn’t oﬀer a complete description of who they are.\\nGenderidentity and sex usually ‘match’, but not always.\\n \\n\"Sex is between the legs, while gender is between the ears.\"\\n \\nGender Non-conforming (or Gender Queer) : Describes a person who does not identify as a man or a woman.\\n \\nTransgender/Transsexual: This describes people who don’t conform or identify with the gender expectations\\nassociated with their sex at birth. This can include people who live as the gender they feel inside, altering their\\nbodies with hormone therapy and sometimes surgery so that their bodies match their gender identity. This also\\nincludes people who identify as transgender or transsexual. In this fact sheet, we’ll use ‘transgender’ or ‘TRANS’ as\\numbrella terms.\\n \\nTwo Spirit:  This is a reclaimed concept from First Nations, Inuit and Métis people. It refers to Indigenous people\\nwho are born one sex, and fulﬁll roles across sex and gender lines, including roles reserved for Two Spirit people.\\nSome say they maintain balance by housing both the male and female spirit. Two Spirit people were considered to\\nbe a gift to the community. They were able to cross a range of genders, hold the balance and were respected and\\nhonoured as visionaries, peacemakers and healers.\\n \\nCross-Dresser (CD):  is someone who wears the clothing assigned by society to the “opposite” sex. People who\\nare CD may or may not be transgender.\\nHow Does Gender Identity Develop?\\nResearchers have studied many possible ways gender identity develops, but there is no clear answer. The best\\nanswer we can give is that gender identity develops from many factors working together. You may be worried that\\nthe questions your child is having about gender is caused by something you did or didn’t do. This is not the case,\\nthere is no evidence to suggest that parenting or any other outside exposure contributes to children becoming\\ntransgender. Your child’s gender identity is unique, and he or she is just trying to express how they feel inside.\\n \\nWe don’t choose our gender identity. Being transgender or gender nonconforming is not a choice. But people’s life\\nsituations can determine how free they feel to express their true gender identity.\\nHow Common Is It For People To Be Transgender Or Transsexual?\\nOlder studies reported that transgender identities were quite rare, but more recent studies show that they are\\nmore common. And studies assess diﬀerent things, for example, some report on the number of people who have\\ncompleted gender reassignment surgery, while other studies report on the number of people who have changed\\nthe gender on their passport.\\n \\nTelephone surveys in the US in 2010 indicated that 1 in 200 people were transgender. The numbers of transgender\\npeople appear to be increasing.

Unfortunately, people who are gender non-conforming, gender variant or\\ntransgender can experience discrimination and rejection. Much pain could be avoided if all transgender people\\nwere treated with the acceptance and respect that every person deserves.\\nHow Do I Know If My Child or Teen is Transgender? \\nMany boys and girls experiment with diﬀerent gender behaviours as they are growing up. Many boys may try on\\ngirl’s clothing, and many girls may try on boy’s clothing.\\n \\nChildren and youth who are questioning their gender identity may experience mild to severe discomfort with the\\nsex they were born with. Below is a list of feelings and behaviours that transgender children and youth may\\nexperience, to one degree or another.\\n \\nFor example, a boy (who is actually trans female) might: \\nExpress unhappiness at being a boy.\\nExpress the wish “to be” a girl, and say they will grow up to be a woman.\\nActively prefer dressing in clothes that typically girls would wear.\\nAvoid undressing in public change rooms.\\nAvoid public washrooms.\\nPlay “stereotypical” games and hobbies of girls (for example, playing with dolls).\\nBe more comfortable in the company of other girls.\\nAvoid “rough-and-tumble” play and competitive sports.\\nHave little interest in cars and trucks.\\nInsist on sitting to urinate.\\nPretend not to have a penis by pushing it in between their legs.\\nShow confusion, or stress over their penis.\\nChoose a female avatar for computer games or a feminine alias in email addresses.\\nOn the other hand, the person might work really hard to prove they are their assigned gender identity. They\\nmay get try to get involved in typically masculine activities, like rough sports. \\nFor example, a girl (who is actually trans male) might:\\nWant to be “male”.\\nPrefer boy’s clothing and short-hair, to the point where others may mistake the girl for a boy.\\nPrefer to be with boys and to play “boy’s games”.\\nShow less interest in activities that typically other girls would engage in.\\nAvoid undressing in public change rooms.\\nAvoid public washrooms.\\nChoose a male avatar for computer games, or a masculine alias in email addresses.\\nMay show confusion, or stress over her vulva or vagina (or breasts when they begin to develop).\\nMay insist that one day she will grow up to be a man.\\nIt is possible that these behaviours in a very young boy or girl may not continue. If youth begin to or still are\\nquestioning their gender identity in the teen years, it is more likely that they will maintain a trans gender identity\\nor remain gender non-conforming. Some children and youth may not be able to express in words, or feel safe or\\ncomfortable describing their struggle. If youth do not feel supported by family, they may stop expressing their\\nthoughts and feelings (‘closeting’ themselves).\\nWhat Should We Do If We Think Our Child or Teen Is Questioning Gender\\nIdentity or is Transgender?\\nMany transgender children and youth hide their questions and feelings about their gender identity from their\\nfamily. They are afraid of being rejected, of losing their family’s love and support. Our society is not very\\nunderstanding and accepting of transgender, and this can contribute to emotional diﬃculties like depression,', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Gender Identity, Gender Diversity, and Transgender Issues in Children and Youth.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 4 / 7\\nanxiety, and feelings of isolation. Sometimes these feelings, or behaviours like skipping school or problems in\\nschool are the only signs that youth are struggling.\\n \\nIf you think your child is struggling with gender identity, listen with care. Your child or teen needs your love and\\nsupport more than ever. If you’re ﬁnding this diﬃcult, review the resources at the end of this fact sheet for more\\ninformation and support.\\nWhy Does ‘Gender Identity Disorder’ Exist as a Medical Diagnosis?\\nBeing transgender or gender non-conforming is not a mental illness. However, Gender Identity Disorder (GID) is the\\nmedical term that describes struggles or questions with gender identity. It’s oﬃcially ‘in the books’ as a mental\\ndisorder. Gender Identity Disorder may also be referred to as Gender Dysphoria, Gender Incongruence, or\\nTransgenderism. We know that people who are gender non-conforming or transgender can live happy, healthy and\\nproductive lives if they have the love and support everyone needs.\\n \\nMany people feel that having gender identity in the oﬃcial manual of mental disorders implies that there is\\nsomething wrong with being transgender. There is nothing wrong with being transgender or gender non-\\nconforming. But right now, a diagnosis of GID allows access to medical treatments or surgery. Most hospitals are\\ndoing their best to provide respectful services within the limitations of this diagnosis requirement. \\n \\nTreatment involves accepting a person’s gender identity in a way that makes sense to that person. It might mean\\nsupportive counseling to help a person navigate his or her unique gender identity, and to help families accept this\\nas well. This process allows people to work through all the messages they’ve internalized about what it means to\\nbe transgender. It’s important to note that many of the struggles people have are the result of our society’s\\ntransphobia. Transphobia has a large and negative impact on mental health. Treatment might also mean medical\\ntherapies to help a person’s body match how they see themselves.\\nHow Do We Help Gender Non-Conforming or Transgender Children and\\nYouth?\\nGive your unconditional support, love and acceptance. \\nIf you have just recently learned that your child or teen is questioning gender identity, you might feel quite\\noverwhelmed, upset, and not know what to do. Remember that your child or teen may have been very\\nworried about how you would react. Your child needs your love and reassurance more than ever. Children\\nand youth need to hear that being transgender does not make you love them any less.\\nIt’s important to use the name your child or teen prefers, as well as the preferred pronoun (he or she). This\\nwill mean a lot to your child or teen. You may need to get support for yourself, so you can be a strong\\nsupport for your child or teen.\\n \\nCounselling. \\nChildren, youth and families can beneﬁt from supportive counseling or psychotherapy. The goal of\\ncounseling is to support youth and their families as they adjust. Counseling can help guide youth and\\nfamilies along the journey of gender identity consolidation, and support them as they face the challenges\\nthey are likely to encounter. Youth and families can also learn about the wide range of other treatment\\noptions so they can make well informed decisions.\\n \\nHormone therapies. \\nPediatric endocrinologists who are experienced in treating transgender adolescents (up to age 18) may\\nprescribe medications that suppress the physical changes of puberty (also known as hormone blockers).\\nThis treatment is only given to adolescents who 1) Meet gender reassignment eligibility and readiness\\ncriteria and 2) Have started to show physical signs of puberty (conﬁrmed by hormone blood tests).

The eﬀects are temporary, so that if a youth stops\\ntaking them, physical changes of puberty begin again.\\nAt age 16, cross-sex hormone therapy can begin. The timing can be important and depends on the teen’s\\nreadiness and support systems. Unnecessary delays or moving ahead too soon may increase the chance of\\npsychological or social problems later on.

Some may not live full time as their\\ngender, and only express their gender when it’s safe to do so.\\n \\nTransgender adults can consider treatment options, like:\\nSupportive counseling\\nHormone replacement therapy\\nSex reassignment surgeries.

When people are faced with a loss of someone (or something) important, they may\\nreact by feeling sad, numb, upset and angry. Most of time, people will be able to grieve their\\nloss and move on. Sometimes however, people may have troubles grieving their losses. If this\\nhappens, the good news is that many things that can be done to support a person with their\\ngrieving.\\nWhat is Grief?\\nGrief is the normal response of sadness and other feelings that come from losing someone close to you.\\n \\nFeeling grief is a natural part of life, because at some point, we will all face the loss of a loved one.\\n \\nBereavement is the period after a loss during which a person experiences grief and is in mourning.\\nWhat is Normal Grief?\\nAfter the death or loss of a loved one, you may feel all sorts of feelings such as feeling:\\nSad\\nAnxious, worried or scared\\nEmpty and numb\\nAngry\\nYou may ﬁnd yourself having physical reactions such as:\\nProblems concentrating\\nLoss of appetite\\nDiﬃculty sleeping\\nYou may ﬁnd yourself turning to your spiritual beliefs and religion as a support. On the other hand, others may also\\nﬁnd themselves questioning their spiritual beliefs and religion.\\n \\nAll of these are normal ways that people can respond to grief.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Grief and Bereavement.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 5\\nWhat is the Grieving Process?\\nIn general, people go through various steps when they experience a loss, which include: \\nAccepting the loss\\n \\nExpressing, letting out the feelings that come from the loss, e.g. sadness, anger, guilt, etc.\\n \\nAdjusting to living without the person that you have lost.\\n \\nMoving on with life, by ﬁnding other activities or people of meaning.\\nHow Long Does Bereavement Last?\\nThe amount of time that people spend in their bereavement period can vary widely. If you have lost someone close\\nto you, it can easily be months or even years.\\n \\nIn the beginning, you may feel tearful and cry whenever you think of the person that you have lost. Over time\\nhowever, as you are able to let out your tears, and accept the loss, you will be able to move on and heal.\\nDealing with diﬀerent types of Losses\\nLoss of a pet.  People can become very close to their pets, which become essentially like a part of the family, and\\nthus, the loss of a pet can be just as painful as the loss of a fellow human being.\\n \\nLoss of a child. It is diﬃcult losing a child, as it goes against the natural order. Children are simply not supposed\\nto die ahead of their parents.\\n \\nLoss of a spouse.  Losing a spouse is particularly diﬃcult. You may ﬁnd special anniversaries and events diﬃcult.\\nYou may also ﬁnd it hard to cope practically. For example, if your spouse was the main one who did groceries, or\\nwho did the cooking, then you will need to ﬁnd a way to cope with this change.\\nIf you have lost a spouse, you will need some time to grieve the loss. When you are feeling stronger, consider the\\nfollowing:\\nUpdating your will\\nSpeak with your lawyer to designate who will help make medical decisions for you, in the event you are\\nunable to make your own medical decisions\\nTransferring joint property to your name\\nReviewing your life, disability and other insurance\\nTaking care of any other tasks that your spouse used to do, e.g. banking, paying bills, etc.\\nLoss due to suicide. Dealing with suicide can be diﬃcult. You may ﬁnd yourself feeling angry at the person for\\nending their life. On the other hand, you might feel guilty or responsible for the loss.\\n \\nPlanned and expected losses: In cases such as cancer or terminal illnesses, you may experience anticipatory\\ngrief, the mourning that occurs when you are expecting death. Grief is never easy, but with anticipatory grief, at\\nleast it gives you an opportunity to prepare for the loss. It gives you a chance to express your feelings to your\\nloved one, and to ensure that you have resolved any unresolved issues.\\n \\nUnplanned loss: When a loss is sudden and unexpected, it tends to be more overwhelming because it is\\nunexpected. You might have been in the midst of a disagreement or conﬂict with your loved one, which may\\ncontribute to guilt.\\nHow Can I Cope with a Loss?', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Grief and Bereavement.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

This includes directly ensuring that they are safe and out of danger, as well as keeping to\\nroutines and being more available for them.

This is a diﬃcult experience for a person of any age, but\\nis particularly hard for young people. Adults may be uncertain on how to respond to the needs of children during\\nthis time. They might be overwhelmed with their own grief or have questions about how to explain such a diﬃcult\\nconcept in ways that children can understand. Even when adults respond the best that they can, a child may still\\nbe overwhelmed by grief issues. \\n \\nThis article describes how children are aﬀected by grief and bereavement, and what family and friends can do to\\nsupport a grieving child.\\nChildren’s Understanding of Death\\nChildren respond diﬀerently to the death of a loved one based on their age and developmental level:\\nAge 0-2: Infants and toddlers are unable to understand the concept of death. From their perspective, their\\nloved one (such as a parent) is simply not there anymore, and they react to it the same way that they would\\nto a separation or abandonment by a caregiver. Thus, a child may respond in various ways -- frustration at\\nthe change in caregivers, being more clingy to a parent, or through not appearing to care. \\nAge 2-6: Preschool children are beginning to understand the concept of death, but they see death as \\nreversible  where dead people can come back to life not unlike going to sleep and then waking up. Because\\nthey view adults as  powerful, they may also believe that the adult chose to die on purpose. Preschoolers\\nare also self-centered, and as a result, may view death as being about them and think. that it is their fault or\\nthat they are being punished for being bad in some way. \\nAge 6-11: School-aged children are able to understand that death is permanent, but may still have troubles\\nunderstanding why their loved one had to die.\\nAge 12+:  Teenagers are capable of fully understanding that death is irreversible, and that it happens to\\neveryone.

The loved one may be a person,\\nbut can also be a pet. Some of the ways a child may respond include:\\nSadness: The child expresses sadness at the loss, which is the most typical reaction to losing a loved one.\\nAnger: Losing a loved one is not fair, and sends the message that the world is an unfair place. This may lead\\nto anger and irritability, which may be directed at themselves or others. \\nIncreased anxiety:  Losing their loved one sends the message that the world is a dangerous and unsafe\\nplace. As a result, the child may have anxiety and fears about dying and losing other loved ones which may\\nlead to them becoming clingy and afraid to separate from caregiver(s) as a result. \\nShock/denial: The child is so overwhelmed at the loss that the child tries to avoid facing or dealing with the\\nloss. This may include avoiding talking about the loss.\\nGuilt: In some cases, the child may blame him- or herself for the loss. “Maybe if I had been a better child…”\\n“Maybe if I hadn’t told grandma that I hated her that time…”\\nProblems functioning at home or school: At school, a child may start having problems with school work while\\nat home a child may be withdrawn and unable to participate in family  activities. A child may also develop\\nbehaviour problems and not follow direction from adults.  They may also become aggressive as a way of\\nexpressing their anger and sadness. with oppositionality, deﬁance or aggression. \\nAcceptance: The child accepts the loss and learns to live with it, and is able to go on with his/her life and is\\nable to talk about the loss. \\nDo’s\\nAccept that your child may be more needy and clingy than usual. Ways to support your child\\'s increased needs for\\nconnection include:\\nSpend more time with your child, preferably 1:1 time. Especially if you have more than one child, it may be\\nhard to ﬁnd 1:1 time, because the other children tend to be around. However, it may be harder for a child to\\nopen up about feelings when others are around, hence the rationale for 1:1 time.\\nProvide plenty of physical aﬀection such as plenty of hugs and kisses.\\nWhen your child is faced with a break in your connection (e.g. such as through physical separation when\\ngoing to school, or going to bed), speciﬁcally mention the next time that you will see you child.\\nE.g. at bedtime, say the usual statements such as \"I love you\" but also speciﬁcally talk about the next time\\nyou will see your child, such as \"See you later today, and I can\\'t wait until we go for our walk together.\"\\nThe rationale is similar to what we intuitively do when we go on a date with someone. At the end of a\\nsuccessful date, how would you feel if the other person just said, \"Goodnight!\" and left? You\\'d feel empty...\\nYou feel better if the other person talks about the next time that you\\'d see each other, e.g. \"Goodnight!\\nLet\\'s get together this weekend!\"\\nTell the child honestly about death so that they can begin to understand that death is ﬁnal. Avoid euphemisms\\nbecause young children tend to take things literally.\\nE.g. Avoid “Grandpa has gone to sleep” as it may make the child be afraid to go to sleep\\nE.g. Avoid “Grandpa has gone on a journey” as it may make the child afraid of journeys.\\nSimply say, “Grandpa died.”\\nBe sensitive to how children understand what you are saying:\\nSimply saying “Grandma got sick and she died” can be problematic because then the child will worry about\\ngetting sick. Instead, follow-up with “grandma got so sick that nothing could help her, not even the usual\\nmedicines”.\\nSimply saying, “Grandma went to the hospital and then she died” can be problematic because then your\\nchild may be afraid that people who go to the hospital will die. Instead, explain that “Normally people get\\nbetter in hospital, but grandma was so sick that she died.”', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Helping Children and Youth With Grief, Bereavement and Loss_ Information for Parents and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Younger child: Grandpa got so sick that his heart stopped working\\nAcknowledge and accept the child’s feelings\\nReassure the child that feelings such as shock, disbelief, guilt, sadness and anger are normal feelings\\nDo not invalidate the child’s feelings. For example, if a child is sad and upset, don’t say things such as\\n“Don’t be sad.”\\nRather, simply acknowledge the pain and oﬀer support, “Yes, it’s sad. This is tough. I love you and we’ll get\\nthrough this. Come on, let me give you a hug…”\\nReassure the child that\\nThey will always be cared for and loved by an adult\\nThat they were not to blame for the death\\nThat they  could not have prevented the death\\nThat they cannot bring back the person who died\\nContinue with regular routines as much as possible so that children are able to feel like things are in control. \\nContinue with family routines and discipline. Although adults may sometimes feel a need to “start fresh”, and\\nmake changes after the loss of a loved one (e.g. including moving elsewhere), children generally beneﬁt from\\nconsistency and routine. Thus, it is better for the children to continue living in the same neighborhood, going to the\\nsame school, and having the same friends and activities. \\nShare any religious beliefs about death that you have that will help the child make sense and have meaning of the\\nloss. \\nHelp the child acknowledge the loss by giving opportunities to talk about the loved one who has died. For example:\\nTell stories about the loved one who died.\\nTalk about the positives, e.g.  Caregiver: “What did you like the most about (the deceased person)?\"\\nFind out what the child misses about the loved one so that you can talk to them about these speciﬁc needs,\\ne.g. Caregiver: “What do you miss the most about (the deceased person)?” \\nExplore any negative feelings that the child may have:\\nIn cases where children are “stuck” in their grieving process, it may be due to having negative\\nfeelings (such as anger or guilt) towards the deceased.\\nParent: “With people that we care about, sometimes we get upset at them. Anything that you’re\\nupset at (deceased person) about?”\\nInclude children in rituals such as funerals or a memorial service. \\nMost children are able to go to a funeral or memorial. Prepare the child in advance for what is going to\\nhappen and be ready to answer questions at the funeral or memorial. If a child does not want to go, ask\\nwhy, e.g. “What are you worried about?” If the child still doesn’t want to go despite your best eﬀorts, it is\\nbest to not force them. \\nRead age-appropriate books for children about loss and death..\\nAccept that grieving does not just occur as a single one time event, but may happen again and again.  \\nEven if it seems like a child has successfully grieved a loss, caregivers will have to be aware that the child\\nmay need more support later, because as children grow to new developmental stages, they may grieve\\nagain. For example: A toddler reacts with frustration at the change in caregivers when her mother dies, but\\nis unable to verbalize the grief. As she grows older, she begins to be able to express her sadness. As a\\nteenager going to graduation, she grieves again that her mother was never able to see her graduate.\\nKeep in mind that anniversaries can be challenging times when there may be increased feelings of grief. These\\nmay include a) a few weeks after the loss when support from others often drops oﬀ; b) one year anniversary; c)\\nholidays and birthdays. During these times, check more closely how the child is doing. Normal, healthy activities\\nduring anniversary periods might include 1) talking about the loved one, 2) looking at photo albums; 3) going to\\nthe cemetery to visit the loved one.Read age-appropriate books for children about grief and bereavement', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Helping Children and Youth With Grief, Bereavement and Loss_ Information for Parents and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

They can have life-threatening\\nconsequences. Behaviors that include dieting, bingeing, self-induced vomiting, using diet pills and laxatives are\\nseen in more than 27% of girls aged 12 to 18 years.\\n \\nEating disorders develop in boys and girls for a lot of diﬀerent reasons. Eating disorders may stem from anxiety or\\ndepression, or from feeling a loss of control due to a family situation, trauma, or other stresses. Those who tend to\\ndevelop eating disorders are often perfectionists. They may also have tendencies towards being obsessive-\\ncompulsive. Once started, eating disorders may become self-perpetuating. The dieting, bingeing and purging may\\nhelp some people cope and feel in control of their lives while at the same time undermining physical health, self-\\nesteem and the sense of competence and control.\\nWhat can parents do to help prevent an eating disorder?\\nWe tend to think of eating disorders as a “teenage girl issue”, but it is never too early to lay the groundwork for\\nhelping your child recognize that a healthy body is a beautiful body.\\nAs a parent, or involved adult, you are an important ROLE MODEL when it comes to sensible eating, sensible\\nexercise and self-acceptance.

Hoarded items ﬁll the person's home, and can cause severe problems with day-\\nto-day activities and relationships, and even pose a danger to life through being a ﬁre and\\nsafety hazard. The good news is that there are many strategies, treatments and supports to help\\nthose who hoard.\\nIntroduction\\nBob lives in a house, but has collected so many books and newspapers that they have ﬁlled his rooms and\\nhallways. Just last week, his wife left him due to the clutter. \\nCathy has secretly kept over thirty cats in her small home. Just week, neighbours have complained and she is\\nworried that she’ll be forced to get rid of them.\\nIntroduction\\nIt is normal that human beings need to acquire and use various possessions in order to survive.\\nUnfortunately, some people end up 1) collecting too many things, and 2) have troubles getting rid of possessions\\nthat they no longer need. When severe enough, it may be hoarding disorder…\\nWhat is Hoarding Disorder?\\nAccording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), hoarding disorder is characterized\\nby persistent diﬃculty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value, to the point that it\\ncauses harmful eﬀects for the person, or to those around the person (e.g. family members or landlords).\\nHarmful eﬀects of excess clutter include:\\nRendering rooms and hallways unusable: When hoarding is severe enough, a home becomes so full of\\npossessions that there are blocked hallways, exits and rooms. This leads to ﬁre hazards, problems with\\ninsects, and becomes a public health issue, especially if the person lives in an apartment. In extreme cases,\\npeople have died -- due to stacks of possessions collapsing and crushing people, or leading to the person\\nbeing trapped and starving to death at home.\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Hoarding.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

In\\npeople that hoard, their connections with possessions can replace and crowd out their connections to people\\nand activities. If a hoarder lives with other people, it usually causes conﬂicts with others. The whole family\\nmay become isolated, and/or partners will leave.\\nCommon items that are hoarded may include:\\nClothing,\\nNewspapers and magazines,\\nAnimals (e.g. having numerous pets such as cats, that are well in excess of local bylaws).\\nHow Common Is It?\\nHoarding occurs in 2-5% of the population (Samuels, 2008), generally in individuals in their 50’s. Although popular\\nshows such as \"Hoarders\" have increased public awareness about hoarding, it is still diﬃcult to estimate how many\\npeople have problems with hoarding as hoarders usually keep their hoarding secret.\\nHoarding urges occur in children and youth as well, but since they tend to live in a household (that is owned and\\ncontrolled by adult caregivers), their ability to acquire and save possessions is limited compared to adults. Thus,\\nsevere hoarding does not usually begin to be a problem until adulthood, and even then, may take decades before\\nit comes to the attention of professionals.\\nWhy Do People Hoard?\\nHoarding involves two steps:\\n1. Acquiring things, which can happen for many reasons such as:\\nThe culture of materialism reinforced constantly in advertising and popular culture tricks people into\\nthinking they need or want something.\\nAcquiring things is pleasurable: As hunter-gatherers, we are wired to gather, and for many, it is pleasurable.\\n2. Inability to discard things, which can happen for many reasons such as:\\nThey may feel that the item has functional value (e.g. “One day, I might use this fruit juicer.”)\\nThey may feel that the item has helpful information (e.g. “I might one day read this book.”\\nThey may feel that the item is rare and hard to replace (e.g. “They no longer make this CD.”)\\nThe item may have sentimental value (e.g. “My grandmother gave this to me.” “My ﬁrst love from high\\nschool wrote this letter.”)\\nThey may have distress with throwing out things: In many cases, they may have had problems grieving and\\ndealing with loss.\\nThey may have an actual problem with their ability to organize which makes it hard to get rid of things. They\\nmay not notice they have several of the same identical item, when they only need one.\\nSelf-Help for Hoarding\\nIs hoarding so severe that it poses a ﬁre safety hazard? E.g. piles of newspapers blocking ﬁre exits.\\nIf so, then a high priority is\\nDeclutter so that you have free routes in and out of the residence\\nDeclutter so that you have entrance and exits from each room.\\nDeclutter around heat and ignition sources, i.e. furnaces, stoves, portable heaters, baseboard\\nheaters, water heaters or uncovered light bulbs,\\nMake sure smoke detectors are functioning.\\nOnce safety issues have been addressed, then consider the following advice from Marie Kondo’s KonMari method.\\nStep 1: Discard things that you no longer need, or that no longer spark joy', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Hoarding.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Mental illnesses are brain conditions, and\\nindividuals with brain conditions deserve our support, much as you would support someone with\\nconditions in any other part of the body. Simple things like spending our time, listening and\\nbeing helpful to the person are simple yet powerful ways we can show our love and support.\\nWhen that is not enough, then family and friends can play a key role in helping our loved ones\\nget support from health professionals.\\nIntroduction\\nIf someone you love is sick, it can be scary. When they are sick with a mental health issue it can be especially\\nscary. It can be hard to see someone you love in pain and it’s confusing when someone you know well is not acting\\nlike themselves. You know how you would take care of them if they had a cold or ﬂu; but what do you do when\\ntheir illness is a mental one? Just like if someone you love develops diabetes, someone with a mental illness needs\\nextra love and support. You may not be able to see the illness, but it doesn’t mean that you’re powerless to help.\\nHow do I know when to help?\\nSome signs that a friend or family member may have a mental disorder and could need your help are:\\nThey suddenly no longer have interest in hobbies and other interests they used to love\\nThey seem to feel angry or sad for little or no reason\\nThey don’t seem to enjoy anything anymore\\nThey have told you about or seem to be hearing strange voices or having unsettling thoughts\\nThey seem emotionally numb, like they don’t feel anything anymore\\nThey used to be healthy, but now they’re always\\nsaying they feel a bit sick\\nThey eat a lot more or less than they used to\\nTheir sleep patterns have changed\\nThey seem to be anxious or terriﬁed about situations or objects in life that seem normal to you and to others\\nThey’ve been missing more and more time from\\nwork or school\\nThey’ve been drinking heavily and/or using drugs to cope\\nThey are talking about taking their life or feeling hopeless', metadata={'source': './content/docs/How to Support a Family Member or Friend with Mental Health Needs.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 3\\nThey are avoiding their close friends and family members\\nHow can I help?\\nResearch conﬁrms that support from family and friends is a key part of helping someone who is going through a\\nmental illness. This support provides a network of practical and emotional help. These networks can be made up of\\nparents, children, siblings, spouses or partners, extended families, close friends and others who care about us like\\nneighbours, coworkers, coaches and teachers. Some people have larger networks than others, but most of us have\\nat least a few people who are there for us when we need them.\\n \\nThere are a number of major ways that family and friends can help in someone’s journey of recovery from a mental\\ndisorder:\\nKnowing when something is wrong— or right: Getting help early is an important part of treating mental\\nillness, and because they spend time with us, family and friends are often the ﬁrst ones to notice that\\nsomething is wrong. See “How do I know when to help?” on the next page for signs to watch for. Because\\nﬁnding a treatment that works is often a process of trial and error, family members may also be the ﬁrst to\\nsee signs of improvement.\\nHow do I do this?  TIP: Learn more about the signs and symptoms of diﬀerent mental illnesses. Also\\nlearn more about how treatments work so that you know what side eﬀects you may see, when to look\\nfor improvements and which ones to look for ﬁrst. A recent review found that when the family is\\neducated about the illness, the rates of relapse in their loved ones were reduced by half in the ﬁrst\\nyear.\\nSeeking help:  Families and friends can be important advocates to help loved ones get through those hard,\\nearly stages of having a mental disorder. They can help their loved one ﬁnd out what treatment is best for\\nthem. They can also be key in letting professionals know what’s going on, ﬁlling in parts of the picture that\\nthe person who’s ill may not be well enough to describe on their own.     \\nHow do I do this?  TIP: Oﬀering to make those ﬁrst appointments with a family doctor to ﬁnd out\\nwhat’s wrong and/or accompanying the person who’s unwell to the doctor can often be welcome to\\nsomeone who may not have the energy or concentration to do it all by themselves. If you do\\naccompany the person, work with them to write down any notes or questions either of you have in\\nadvance so that you cover all the major points. If they want to do it on their own, show them your\\nsupport and ask them if there’s anything you could do to help.\\nTIP: You can’t always prevent a mental health crisis from happening. If your loved one needs to go to\\nhospital, try and encourage them to go on their own. If they refuse and are very unwell, you can\\nensure the person gets treated in an emergency through BC’s Mental Health Act. See our fact sheet\\non “Getting Help during Crises and Emergencies,” so that you know what to do if this happens. The\\nsheet also has resources to help prevent crises or prepare emergency plans in advance.\\nHelping with medications, appointments and treatments: Because you spend so much time around\\nyour loved ones, you can help them remember to take their medications. You may also be able to help tell a\\ndoctor why medications aren’t being taken as they should be. Similarly, you may be involved in reminding\\nyour loved one to do their counseling homework or use their light therapy treatment each morning, or to\\nmake or keep appointments for treatment.\\nHow do I do this?  TIP: If you’re noticing that your loved one is having trouble taking their medication,\\nyou should mention it to their doctor or pharmacist. They can suggest ways to make pill taking\\neasier. If there are other problems with taking medicine like side eﬀects or other worries, encourage\\nyour loved one to write down their concerns and questions and talk to their doctor. If they don’t have\\na good relationship with their doctor, help them ﬁnd a new one. If cost is a barrier, learn about BC’s\\nno-charge psychiatric medication coverage called Plan G.\\nTIP: Suggest your loved one keep a symptom journal to track how they feel each day before, during\\nand after treatment as well noting things that trigger more symptoms.\\nSupporting a healthy lifestyle:  Families can also help with day-to-day factors such as ﬁnances, problem\\nsolving, housing, nutrition, recreation and exercise, and proper sleeping habits.\\nHow do I do this? TIP: See our Wellness Modules at www.heretohelp.bc.ca for practical tips on how to\\nhave a healthy lifestyle for both you and your loved onE.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/How to Support a Family Member or Friend with Mental Health Needs.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 3 / 3\\nTIP: Staﬀ at mental health centres in your community may be able to help with life skills training as\\nwell as connections to income and housing.\\nProviding emotional support:  You can play an important role in helping someone who’s not feeling well\\nfeel less alone and ashamed. They are not to blame for their illness, but they may feel that they are, or may\\nbe getting that message from others. You can help encourage hope.\\nHow do I do this?  TIP:  Try to be as supportive, understanding and patient as possible. See our\\n“Where do I go from here?” section for resources on how to be a good communicator.\\nTIP: Taking care of an ill family member or friend can be stressful. Remember that you need\\nemotional support too. Consider joining a support group for family members of people with mental\\nillness. There you can connect with other people going through the same things and they can help\\nyou work through your own emotions.

For\\nmany people, the natural response to this is to avoid sound, but this can end up making the\\nperson even more hypersensitive over time. Ways to get help include seeing an audiologist.\\nStrategies that may be helpful depending on the situation might include desensitization by\\nlistening to constant, pleasant, low-level background noise whenever possible, such as quiet\\nnature sounds or relaxation music.\\nJ's Story \\nJ. is an 12-year-old who loves to spend time at home when it is quiet. J. has no siblings and spends much time in\\ntheir quiet bedroom. However, situations such as the school bus and the classroom are overwhelming. It has\\nreached a point where J. tries to avoid going to school, and it’s a daily struggle to get J. to the bus stop. J. also\\nstruggles with anger and anxiety and has seen counsellors for coping strategies such as deep breathing, but\\nnothing seems to help. \\nJ’s mother can relate as she is also distressed by sound as well, and it continues to make life challenging for her.\\nWhat should J’s parents do?\\nWhat Is It?\\nHyperacusis (aka auditory hypersensitivity) is a condition in which a person is abnormally hypersensitive to sound.\\nThus everyday sounds are unbearably loud, causing discomfort, pain and distress.\\nPeople with hyperacusis experience abnormally increased sound-induced activity within their auditory system.\\nNon-intrusive sounds (such as sounds that are not very loud) become uncomfortable and annoying for a child with\\nhyperacusis (Jastreboﬀ, 2004).\\nWho Gets It?\\nHyperacusis occurs at all ages and can disrupt all aspects of home, school, work and relationships.\\nWith children, school can become unbearable, as the classroom, cafeteria, and gymnasium are all very noisy\\nsettings.

Daily sounds that may be distressing\\ncan include a running faucet, home appliances (e.g. vacuum cleaner, dishwasher), or people having conversations.\\nWhat Causes It?\\nHyperacusis is often seen along with other conditions such as:\\nAuditory conditions • Hearing loss (a reduced ability to hear sounds, which can occur at any age, and can be\\ngradual or sudden).\\n• Tinnitus (a buzzing or ringing noise in the ears that only the person with tinnitus can\\nhear).\\n    ⚬ Most adults who complain of hyperacusis have tinnitus, and many who complain of\\ntinnitus also have hyperacusis.\\n• Following exposure to loud noise such as:\\n    ⚬ A single exposure to loud noise such as an explosion, a gunshot\\n    ⚬ Long-term exposure such as work exposure in a factory, at a construction site or\\nbeing a musician.\\nHead and neck conditions • Bell’s palsy\\n• Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)\\n• Chronic migraines\\n• Meniere’s disease\\n• Surgery to the jaw, face or ears\\nBrain and related conditions • Concussions and head injuries (very common)\\n• Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\\n• Depression\\n• General Anxiety Disorder (GAD)\\n• Anxiety and depression (very common)\\n    ⚬ 56% of patients with hyperacusis met the criteria for a psychiatric condition, which\\nspeaks to how stressful hyperacusis can be (Jastreboﬀ, 2018).\\n• Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)\\n    ⚬ 40% of those with ASD have auditory hypersensitivity, aka hyperacusis.\\n• Attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\\nInfections • Viral infection of the inner ear\\n• Lyme disease\\nMedications • Certain drugs can aﬀect hearing in some people, e.g. non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory\\ndrugs (NSAIDS) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen; antibiotics; water pills and diuretics.\\nFeatures of Hyperacusis\\nTypically, both ears are aﬀected, although it is possible to have it in only one ear.\\nRelated Sound Conditions\\nOther types of sound sensitivity include:\\nMisophonia, which causes a great deal of emotional distress with certain speciﬁc types of sounds such as:\\nMouth-related sounds such as chewing and breathing\\nTapping with the feet when someone walks\\nTyping on the computer\\nEnvironmental sounds like toilet ﬂushing\\nOther types of reduced tolerance to sound include:\\n‘Loudness recruitment’, which is an abnormal growth in loudness often caused by hearing loss.\\n‘Phonophobia’, which is a persistent and unwarranted fear of sound.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Hyperacusis_ When Everything is Too Loud.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

The child may have an existing stuﬀed animal and\\ntreat it as if it has its own unique personality (such as with \"Hobbes\" in the comic strip, Calvin and Hobbes).\\nToys.\\nGender diﬀerences\\nGirls tend to be more likely to have imaginary friends than boys (Carlson, 1993);\\nLittle girls typically take on a nurturing, teacher-like role with their imaginary companions, who often take\\nthe form of baby animals or baby humans (Carlson, 1993)\\nLittle boys’ imaginary friends are frequently characters who are more competent than they are, such as\\nsuperheroes or beings with powers (Carlson, 1993)\\nMost of the time they are nice, and can help with coping. But sometimes, children report their imaginary friend is a\\nnuisance, and may even have arguments with their friend (Carlson, 1993).\\nWhy Do Kids Have Imaginary Companions?\\nIn order to have an imaginary friend, a child needs to have enough ‘social intelligence’ and “theory of mind”, which\\nis the understanding that other people have diﬀerent thoughts/feelings than you, also known as “theory of mind”.\\nThis usually starts around age 4-5. Before developing their “theory of mind”, young children do not understand\\nthat other people can have diﬀerent thoughts or wants than them.\\n \\nImaginary companions can be very helpful in meeting various needs such as:\\nNeed to feel competent: When the child has a leadership, protective or expert role with an imaginary\\ncompanion, it allows them to feel competent.\\nNeed to be in control: It also helps the child be in control, and practice social situations with no risk.

The ﬁrst 2000 days of life is\\nthe most critical time of brain development. It makes over 1,000,000 new connections every second and is always\\nchanging and developing. While its best to start early, its also never too late to build positive mental health.\\nDo’s\\nHave a healthy relationship and bond with your child. A key part of positive mental health is about the\\nspecial bond a parent or caregiver has with a child. When your child expresses their needs (e.g. crying), it is\\nimportant to consistently respond in a warm and sensitive way (e.g. soothing them, meeting their\\nunderlying needs such as hunger). This promotes a secure attachment, which is the foundation for your\\nchild having future healthy relationships and success and wellness in life.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health (IECMH).pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

As parents, our duty is to ﬁgure out\\nwhat our child needs and meet that need. By consistently meeting our child's needs, a child will\\nlearn that the world can meet his/her needs, and will thus grow up healthy, secure and trusting\\nof others. If we fail to meet our child's needs, a child learns that the world cannot meet his/her\\nneeds, leading to lack of trust, and all manner of future emotional and behaviour problems.\\nIntroduction\\nCrying is the main way your baby can tell you what he or she needs. How you respond when your baby cries during\\nthe ﬁrst year of life will teach your baby if he or she can count on you.\\n \\nNo one can comfort a baby ALL the time.

This can make a baby learn to pretend that he or2.\\nshe is not upset when he or she needs comforting most.

It is not up to\\nbabies to meet our needs. It is up to us as parents to meet our babies’ needs.\\nWhen parents are not consistent, their babies learn that they cannot depend on their mom or dad. The baby never\\nknows what to expect and has to work hard to get their parent’s attention. They may become clingy and\\ndemanding, or helpless and withdrawn. When these babies grow up, they are likely to have problems getting along\\nwith other children and adults.\\n \\nIt is not easy being the parent of a new baby. Often you are tired and have too much to do. That makes it hard to\\nbe patient when your baby cries. Some babies cry a lot and may be hard to comfort. This may make you feel\\nhelpless and upset. That is normal. However, your baby really needs you to be calm, soothing and comforting to\\nhelp him or her feel better. When you cannot comfort your baby calmly, take a break and get someone to help you.\\nAll parents need someone to help them at times.\\n \\nYour baby’s cry is not a habit to break. It is a message that he or she needs you and that you should respond with\\nwarmth and love.\\n \\nIf your baby feels you love him or her, your baby will feel good about himself or herself.

The bad news is that sometimes parents\\ncan be overwhelmed from their own issues, which may lead a parent to be upset, sad, angry or\\nemotionally distant from their child. The good news however, is that even if you had a negative\\npast, your child represents an opportunity for a fresh start for a new life, and an opportunity to\\nbreak any negative cycles from your own past.\\nIntroduction\\nParents who are carrying sad or angry feelings from their past may have a diﬃcult time parenting their children. If\\nwe feel upset, sad, angry or even “blank out” a lot of the time, we can be scary or even harmful to our children.\\nThis is the last thing any parent wants.\\n \\nChildren who are frightened by things their parents say or do cannot count on their parents for protection. They\\nmay show their hurt in diﬀerent ways. For example, by:\\nBeing aggressive to people, animals, and themselves\\nNot getting along with other children and adults\\n“Blanking out”, saying “no” a lot, or not being able to sit still and calm down\\nNot feeling good about themselves\\nHaving diﬃculty dealing with unpleasant feelings like anger, sadness, jealousy, or fear\\nMost importantly, when they become parents, they may do things that make their own children feel afraid.

Loud, angry voices can scare children, even\\nyoung babies.

Ignoring your crying child,\\nlaughing, teasing, or hushing your child in anger are not comforting, and can make the world feel like a\\nscary place.\\nWhat you can do: When your child is distressed, hold him or her. Speak soothingly in a soft, loving voice.\\nEven if this approach does not stop the crying right away, it gives the message that you care and that the\\nworld is a safe place.\\n \\nGetting in your child's way: There are many ways you can get in your child’s way, like interrupting when 3.\\nyour child is speaking, or taking a toy away to look at something you are more interested in. You should\\nnever hurt your child on purpose. Games like “I’m going to get you!” or throwing your child into the air,\\nexcessive tickling or roughhousing, can also invade your child’s space and send a message that your child’s\\nfeelings and interests don’t matter.\\nWhat you can do: Sit back and watch your child. Join in play when your child invites you. Following your\\nchild’s lead, even for ﬁve minutes a day, lets your child know that his or her space, feelings, and\\nindependence matter.\\n \\nNot being there for your child: You may have a lot on your mind for many reasons; you may be worried, 4.\\nexhausted, or thinking about something from the past. Sometimes people who have been through a lot\\n“blank out” on occasion. But if you do not respond when your child needs you, your child will feel unsafe and\\nunloved, and may develop serious problems.\\nWhat you can do:  If you notice that your mind is wandering when you are with your child, try to bring your\\nattention back. If you “blank out” often, you may need help dealing with unpleasant past experiences so\\nthat you can become more responsive to your child.\\n \\nMaking your child worry about you:  When you turn to your child for comfort or advice, your child will 5.\\nworry about you. It is not up to children to worry about their parents.\\nWhat you can do:  Give your child aﬀection and reassurance and do not burden him or her with your\\nworries.\\nBreaking the Cycle of Hurt for Your Child\\nEvery parent sometimes behaves in these ﬁve ways, but it is a PATTERN of doing these things that can be harmful.\\nIf these behaviours are intense, and they happen over and over again, your child may develop serious problems.\\nPay attention to what you are saying and doing and try to change your behaviour if you sense your child is\\ndistressed or uncomfortable. Do not let hurtful past experiences get in the way of how you relate to your child. If\\nyou ﬁnd that you are having a hard time controlling your own feelings, don’t be afraid to ask for help.

Humans have long mined and used lead, but\\nthis increased signiﬁcantly in the 20th century. It is estimated that between 1920-2000, millions of tons of lead\\nwere mined, and used in many products in and around homes, paint, gasoline, and other substances.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Lead Poisoning.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Page 2 / 4\\nWhat is lead poisoning?\\nAlthough lead can be useful, unfortunately it was eventually discovered that lead is actually poisonous, and causes\\nvarious problems in the human body.\\n \\nFortunately, due to the realization that lead is poisonous, governments have signiﬁcantly restricted the use of lead\\nin products.  As a result, children and adults nowadays are exposed to smaller amounts of lead than in the past.\\n \\nBetween 1976-1980, 88% of children in the USA had harmful levels of lead. Thanks to steps such as banning use of\\nlead in things such as gasoline and paint, by 2000, only 2.2% of US children have harmful levels of lead (National\\nInstitute of Environmental Health Sciences, USA). This is much better, this still means that one in 50 children have\\nharmful levels of lead!\\nWhy is lead still a problem?\\nLead lasts a long time in the environment, and although there is no more lead released from burning leaded\\ngasoline, people can still be exposed to it in other ways such as:\\nLead-based paint: Homes built before 1978 were painted with lead paint, and many outdoor structures are\\nstill painted with lead paint. Over time, paint will wear down, chip and release lead dust into the air. Lead\\npaint in older housing remains the most common source of lead exposure for children in the\\nUnited States.\\nContaminated soil and air: Lead dust is still present in the air from contaminated soil that is blown in the\\nwind. Because lead was widely used in gasoline starting in 1923, millions of tons of lead were released into\\nthe environment in car exhaust. The soil around your home can pick up lead from sources such as exterior\\npaint.\\nContaminated water and food: Lead can contaminate food if you use old lead containing products such as\\ncookware, tin cans, pottery, and glassware. Lead can enter your drinking water through your plumbing, e.g.\\nif the water has ﬂowed through lead pipes or ﬁttings.\\nLead crystal, lead-glazed pottery, and some inexpensive metal jewelry.\\nWorkplace exposure: Adults can become contaminated if they work in industries that still use lead. Lead\\nexposures can occur in activities such as welding, renovation and remodeling, smelters, ﬁring ranges, the\\nmanufacture and disposal of car batteries, and the maintenance and repair of bridges and water towers.\\nHow does lead get into the body?\\nLead can enter the body in two main ways. It can be 1) inhaled via lead dust in the air, or 2) ingested by eating or\\ndrinking food or water that contains lead.\\n \\nOnce inside the body, it goes into the blood, and from there, can be absorbed into the brain, nerves, heart,\\nmuscles, and in particular, bones and teeth. Once in the bones and teeth, the lead can stay in the body for\\ndecades. Over time, some of the stored lead can leave the bones, reenter the bloodstream, and travel to organs\\nagain, where it can aﬀect health. Lead slowly leaves the body in urine and feces.\\nHow does lead damage people's health?\\nLead can cause various problems, including: \\nProblems with the brain, such as problems with attention, memory and behaviour. Lead can cause\\nsymptoms that can make a person appear as if they have other brain conditions such as learning problems,\\nattention deﬁcit / hyperactivity disorder.\\nBrain damage and death\\nAnemia, a condition where you have a lack of blood\\nStomachaches\\nKidney damage\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Lead Poisoning.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

They should not participate in activities that disturb old paint or in cleaning up paint debris after\\nwork is completed.\\nCreate barriers between living/play areas and lead sources. Until environmental clean-up is completed,\\nparents should clean and isolate all sources of lead. They should close and lock doors to keep children away\\nfrom chipping or peeling paint on walls. You can also apply temporary barriers such as contact paper or duct\\ntape, to cover holes in walls or to block children’s access to other sources of lead.\\nRegularly wash children’s hands and toys. Hands and toys can become contaminated from household dust\\nor exterior soil. Both are known lead sources.\\nRegularly wet-mop ﬂoors and wet-wipe window components. Because household dust is a major source of\\nlead, parents should wet-mop ﬂoors and wet-wipe horizontal surfaces every 2-3 weeks. Windowsills and\\nwells can contain high levels of leaded dust. They should be kept clean. If feasible, windows should be shut\\nto prevent abrasion of painted surfaces or opened from the top sash.\\nPrevent children from playing in bare soil; if possible, provide them with sandboxes.

If\\nusing a sandbox, parents should also cover the box when not in use to prevent cats from using it as a litter\\nbox. That will help protect children from exposure to animal waste.\\nTo further reduce a child’s exposure from other sources of lead:\\nAvoid using traditional home remedies and cosmetics that may contain lead;\\nAvoid eating candies imported from Mexico;\\nAvoid using containers, cookware, or tableware to store or cook foods or liquids that are not shown to be\\nlead free;\\nRemove recalled toys and toy jewelry immediately from children.

Academic skills\\n \\nChildren and youth with academic learning disabilities can have problems with:\\nReading (phonics, recognizing words or understanding printed text)\\nWriting (spelling, creating sentences, grammar, using punctuation, expressing thoughts in writing)\\nMath (reasoning, functions like adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing)\\n2. Organization and Focus\\n \\nThese ‘executive functions’ allow us to plan, think ahead and pay attention. Problems in these areas can have a big\\nimpact on how we learn and manage our day to day lives. Learning disabilities in these areas can make it\\nchallenging for some students to organize their time, ﬁnish homework, and remembering when tests and\\nassignments are coming up. Some students may often lose schoolwork, books, clothes or lunch bags. Some people\\nsee ADHD (Attention Deﬁcit/Hyperactivity Disorder) as a learning disability because ADHD aﬀects these ‘executive’\\nfunctions). However, most professionals or school boards do not think ADHD is a learning disability\\n \\nA word about social skills...\\n \\nLearning to work and play with others is an important skill. Children and youth who have trouble picking up on\\nsocial cues, facial expressions and body language can have diﬃculty making friends and getting along with others\\nat school. Such social diﬃculties are not learning disabilities. But children who experience them can beneﬁt when\\neducation programs include social skill building activities.\\nWhat causes learning disabilities?\\nMost learning disabilities are present at birth, and result from the way a child’s brain develops. It is also possible\\nfor a child to develop a learning disability after a brain injury or other problems that eﬀect the brain (like epilepsy).\\nLearning disabilities are not caused by poor parenting, poverty or a child’s lack of motivation (although these\\nthings can deﬁnitely aﬀect learning). There is no ‘cure’ for a learning disability, and children don’t outgrow them.\\nBut with support, children and youth can learn to manage LDs eﬀectively in their daily lives.\\nHow common are learning disabilities?\\nAccording to Statistics Canada, (2006), about 3.2% of Canadian children have a learning disability. That’s about 1\\nout of every 31 children in Canada, about 1 student in every classroom.\\nImpact of learning disabilities\\nLearning disabilities can have major impacts on a child’s life, because so much of a child’s life at home, school and\\nwith peers depends on learning. But the greatest impact is at school. Children and youth with diﬃculties reading\\nand writing will need support in subjects like history, geography, science and language arts.\\n \\nA learning disability may be even more obvious when teachers use methods that make learning even more\\nchallenging for the child or teen. For example:\\nTeaching by talking or lecturing, without using visual aids (like diagrams or written text) can make learning\\ndiﬃcult for students who are ‘visual’ learners.\\nClassrooms where there is an emphasis on writing will be diﬃcult for students with writing disabilities.\\nTechnology that emphasizes the sharing of ideas has made a big diﬀerence for some students. Software is now\\navailable to:\\n‘Read’ text aloud.

Again, this allows students to focus on what they want to say, rather than\\nstruggling with how to spell it and put it into a sentence that makes sense to others.\\nThe good news\\nThe right environment can really improve the potential for learning in children and youth with LDs. Some people\\nbelieve that the main problem is our education system itself, which mostly teaches in one way, making it diﬃcult\\nfor children and youth who learn in diﬀerent ways. The impact of a learning disability also depends on the child,\\nand how much the mode of learning they struggle with is used in their life.\\n \\nChildren and youth with learning disabilities involving reading or writing may do very well in other subjects, like\\nmath, physics, sports, music, dance, design or construction. On the other hand, children and youth with disabilities\\nthat aﬀect math skills may do very well in subjects involving reading and writing.\\nConditions that often occur along with learning disabilities (Comorbid\\nConditions)\\nChildren and youth with learning disabilities may also have problems with:\\nAttention. Many children with learning disabilities also have Attention Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),\\nmaking it diﬃcult for them to focus and pay attention.\\nMood, anxiety and behaviour. Learning disabilities can make school and learning more challenging. They\\nmay also aﬀect social relationships. These stresses can aﬀect moods, and cause anxiety and behaviour\\nproblems. It’s a 2 way street, though. Problems with mood, anxiety and behaviour also aﬀect learning.\\nListening and speaking (which may be part of a Communication Disorder).\\nCoordinating large or small muscle movements. This can mean diﬃculties walking, running, throwing a ball\\nor playing sports. It can also mean trouble with hand writing, drawing or other hand movements.\\nHow do I know if my child has a learning disability?\\nStudents with learning disabilities may:\\nGet poorer grades in just one subject area. For example, a student who does well in all subjects, but is\\nstruggling with math.\\nHave to work very hard (harder than most other students) to get reasonable grades. For example, a student\\nwho usually gets Bs, but must work extra hard for a passing grade in Language Arts.\\nWhat should I do if I think my child has a learning disability?\\nCheck hearing and vision. Problems hearing or seeing can have a big impact on learning. Start by taking\\nyour child to see your family doctor or paediatrician. You can also take your child to an optometrist for vision\\ntesting.\\nSpeak with the school about your concerns. School boards have psychologists who can assess your\\nchild (psycho-educational assessment). After these detailed tests about how your child learns, a\\npsychologist can then decide if your child has a learning disability or not. Wait lists for this testing\\ncan be long. Some parents choose to pay to have a psychologist in private practice assess their\\nchild.\\nIf your child speaks 2 languages (for example, French and English), try to ﬁnd a psychologist who\\nspeaks both of these languages. It may be that your child is having trouble learning in a 2nd\\nlanguage.\\nParenting a child or teen with a learning disability\\nAdjust your expectations to what your child or teen can do.

The LD is a problem with the brain’s ‘wiring’-it’s not your child’s fault.\\nLook for and encourage your child’s strengths, interests, and abilities. Help your child or teen ﬁnd chances\\nto do well at things. You can also use your child’s interests to help with school. For example, if your child has\\ntrouble reading, but loves hockey, books about hockey may help her work on her reading skills.\\nFocus on the eﬀort and the process, instead of grades or the ‘outcome’. “Wow, you have put so much work\\ninto this project!” “You have chosen some beautiful colours for this” “I’m proud of how hard you’re working”\\n“Think of how far you’ve come with this!” “I know this hasn’t been easy, but you’ve done a great job at\\nsticking with it!”\\nLighten the load. Some high school students may do better in school with a lighter course load. It’s okay to\\ntake a little longer to ﬁnish high school-students take an extra year for many reasons. The diploma at the\\nend is what’s important, not the time it took.\\nDon’t let the learning disability ‘deﬁne’ your child or teen. Remind yourself (and your child!) of your child’s\\nstrengths and interests.\\nShare your wisdom. If you have a learning disability, please share your experience and coping strategies.\\nNobody will understand what your child is experiencing better than someone who’s walked the same road.\\nHelp youth take advantage of learning supports. Colleges and universities have many supports for students\\nwith learning disabilities. When students start at college or university, they need to bring a report that\\nconﬁrms the LD diagnosis and outlines the results of their psycho-educational assessment (done in the last\\n2 years). Students can then get the accomodations they need for classes, assignments or tests.\\nHow to help a child or teen with a learning disability\\nThere are many ways to make learning easier for children and youth with LD:\\nBreak down large tasks into smaller ones.\\nTeach speciﬁc skills. Children and youth may need help learning to organize their time, use an agenda or\\nfollow a schedule.\\nAccommodate the student. Change the learning environment to making learning easier by:\\nDeveloping an Individual Education Plan (IEP) that is based on the student’s needs and strengths.

Consider special ‘mobility’ seating (such as the wedge cushion),\\nwhich helps your child to sit and yet still move at the table. Let them stand if they can't sit. Ask them to\\nfetch things for people.\\nConsider distraction during mealtimes. \\nIn general, it is ideal for people to eat together with others without distraction such as from music or video.\\nOn the other hand, if you have tried other strategies and your child is struggling with low intake, then\\nconsider distracting with a family TV show, the news, etc. This is likely something to try during snacks\\nversus the family mealtime. \\nDon’ts\\nDon’t make eating stressful. When your child doesn’t eat, frustrated parents might get angry or upset or\\nthreaten consequences. Unfortunately, it's hard for people to eat if they feel stressed and upset over\\neating. \\nDon’t order your kids around if triggers ‘counter-will.' Some children can easily follow their other's\\ndirections. Other children have a stronger need for autonomy and may get upset when their parent orders\\nthem to eat. If so, consider using gentle comments (i.e. declarative language) that can help by being less\\npressuring than commands.\\nExamples\\nInstead of “It's time to eat now,” you might say, “Dinner is ready!

Having close and genuinely supportive relationships with\\ntheir parents and caregivers is perhaps the single most important factor that protects children\\nand youth from mental health problems.\\nWhat is Mental Health?\\nMental health (like our physical health) is a resource for living. It allows us to learn, work, play and ﬁnd enjoyment\\nin life. It helps us through tough times.\\n \\nFrom a child or teen’s point of view, mental health means…\\nI feel like I have things to live for\\nI feel that people care about me\\nI feel hopeful and good about the future\\nI feel in control of my life\\nI like myself\\nI’m satisﬁed, content or happy with life\\nWhat is Mental Illness?\\nPeople have mental health problems or mental illnesses when problems with thoughts, feelings or behaviours get\\nin the way of functioning at home, school or work.\\n \\nEveryone feels sad or upset from time to time. But when these feelings are so strong that it’s hard to carry on at\\nschool or home, then there may be a mental health problem.\\n \\nFrom a child or teen’s point of view, mental health problems (or mental illnesses) can mean some or all of the\\nfollowing:', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Mental Health and Mental Illness (Children Youth).pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

It may sound strange, but we can have an illness and still have health. Do you know someone with heart\\ndisease? They may need a special diet, exercise plan and medications, but they can still feel ‘well’, and do the\\nthings they need to do. This is also true for mental illnesses. A teen with depression may need regular ‘talk’\\ntherapy and medications. She may need help learning to cope with stress, or how to handle her emotions. But\\nwhen the depression is under control, she can feel well, enjoy school, friends and activities.\\n \\nSometimes though, an illness can be very serious. Even though people do their best and follow their treatment\\ncarefully, they may have to live with limitations. The same is true for people with mental illnesses or brain\\nconditions. Some mental illnesses are more serious, and people may have to live with some limitations. But we still\\nneed to accept and support people whether they have heart disease or a mental health problem.\\nHow common are mental health problems in children and youth?\\nMental health problems are more common than most people realize. In Ontario, 1 in every 5 children and youth\\nhave some type of mental health problem.\\n \\nBut most who need professional help will not get it. Just 1 in 6 children and youth get the help they need. Just\\nimagine if only 1 in 6 people with broken bones got treatment.\\n \\nMental illnesses have a powerful impact on children, youth and those who care for them. Death by suicide is the\\nsecond leading cause of death in youth 15-19 years (the number one cause of death in this age group is\\nunintentional injury, or ‘accidents’).\\nWhat causes mental illness?\\nBoth mental illnesses and physical illnesses are caused by a combination many things, for example:\\nGenetics: How we turn out depends a lot on the ‘genes’ that we’re born with. And we have no control over\\nthe genes we get from our parents. Just like some children develop cancer (through no fault of their own),\\nsome children have a greater chance of developing a mental health problem.\\nFamily history: If a family member has had depression or anxiety, children and youth have a greater chance\\nof developing these problems too.\\nHow we care for our health: Do we eat right? Exercise? Abuse alcohol? Express feelings in a constructive\\nway?\\nOur reactions to experiences: Stressful events can trigger mental and physical illnesses. A child who grows\\nup in a stressful family situation, or where there is abuse or neglect, has a much higher chance of having\\nmental health problems.\\nOur resources: Do we have enough money? Satisfying work? A decent place to live? Opportunities to grow\\nand develop? Friends and family to support us?\\nCan mental illnesses be prevented?\\nJust like we can prevent physical health problems, we can also reduce our chances of developing mental health\\nproblems. We can do things to promote our physical health, by eating healthy food, exercising, not smoking or\\nwearing a seatbelt. But even if we do all these things, we sometimes still get sick or hurt.

Although mental health problems are common today's stressful society, the good\\nnew is that there many things that you can do to be mentally healthy.\\nMental Health vs. Mental Illness \\nMany people talk about mental health and mental illness as if they were the same thing. But they’re not the same\\nthing at all. \\n \\nFor starters, mental health is something we all have. Mental illness only aﬀects some people. Just like physical\\nhealth, there are some things that you can do to be mentally healthy and reduce your chances of developing a\\nmental illness. \\nWhat is Mental Health? \\nMental health is your brain’s ability to: \\nMake sense of and interact with the world around you; \\nEnjoy life; \\nRealize your personal potential; \\nHandle the ups and downs of everyday life. \\nYour brain (or mind) is the starting point for your mental health.

But when these feelings become so strong that it’s\\nhard to carry on at school or home, then it could mean a mental health problem. \\n \\nSome of the most common mental illnesses for young people are depression, anxiety, attention deﬁcit\\nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and eating disorders. \\n \\nDid you know? \\n \\nIn North America, 1 in 5 children and youth will have some type of mental health problem. \\nCan I Have a Mental Illness and Be Mentally Healthy at the Same Time? \\nYes. It may sound strange, but we can have an illness and still have health. Do you know someone with diabetes?\\nThey may need a special diet, exercise plan and medications, but they can still feel ‘well’, and do the things they\\nneed to do. This is also true for mental illnesses. Youth with depression may need regular ‘talk’ therapy and\\nmedications. They may need help learning to cope with stress, or how to handle emotions. But when the\\ndepression is under control, they can feel well, enjoy school, friends and activities. \\nWhat Causes Mental Illness? \\nBoth mental illnesses and physical illnesses are caused by a combination of many things, for example: \\n \\nGenetics \\n \\nThe genes you get from your parents have a big role to play in whether of not you have a risk for developing a\\nmental illness. If your parents or grandparents live with a mental illness, it’s something that could be passed down\\nto you. But having a family history of mental illness doesn’t mean that you will develop one. There are lots of\\nthings you can do to take care of your mental health (more about this later!), and lower the chance that you’ll\\nexperience mental health problems. For example, some people have a family history of heart attacks. If they\\nexercise, eat well and avoid smoking, they can really lower the chance that they’ll have a heart attack. \\n \\nEnvironment \\n \\nYour environment and your experiences have a big inﬂuence on your mental health. Your environment includes: \\nFamily, friends and other support people; \\nYour home, neighbourhood and school; \\nYour culture; \\nDay to day stresses; \\nLife experiences; \\nYour family’s income; \\nOpportunities for learning, recreation and employment. \\nYour mindset \\n \\nThis means: \\nThe way you look at things (your point of view or ‘outlook’); \\nHow you ‘explain’ your experiences to yourself; \\nThe way you connect and interact with others; \\nHow you cope with stress and feelings; ', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Mental Health and Mental Illness_ Youth Edition.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

They may be afraid of being judged by others. This ‘stigma’ is a big \\nreason why youth don’t reach out for help when they need it. Youth may believe that \\nthe struggles they are having are signs of weakness or that they really have no good \\nreason to feel the way they do. Some youth may just ‘tough it out’, and not seek support. \\nWhat Helps to Change Attitudes About Mental Illness? \\nYou can help to reduce stigma and change attitudes about mental illness by: \\nTalking about mental health with people around you; \\nTrying to think about mental health and illness the same way you think about physical health and illness; \\nAccepting friends going through mental health struggles and oﬀering support; \\nNot blaming yourself or others; \\nAsking for help when you need it-this sets a great example for others! \\nWhat Should I Do If I Think I Have a Mental Illness? \\nYou don’t have to be alone through this. Depression, anxiety or other mental health problems often trick people\\ninto thinking that they don’t deserve help, but that’s the mental health problem speaking.

It is the most common\\nillness experienced by youth worldwide.\\n￼￼About 5% of males and 12% of females between the ages of 12 and 19 will have a major depression.\\nStigma around mental illness is the biggest reason why youth don’t ask for help. Getting help early can\\nprevent a lot of pain and suﬀering. Illnesses can also be easier to treat in the early stages.\\nQuestions and Answers (Q & A)?\\nMany young people have questions when their brother or sister has a mental illness. We hope these answers will\\nhelp.\\n \\nQ: How did my brother or sister get a mental illness?\\nA: There are lots of diﬀerent reasons why people get a mental illness. It is usually because of a few things\\nhappening all at the same time, instead of one single reason. Mental illness does run in families, so if a parent or\\nclose relative has a mental illness, there is a greater chance that other members of the family may experience\\nmental illness. Diﬃcult relationships with friends or parents or problems at school (like bullying) can also make\\nthings stressful for young people. With lots of stressors adding up, it is easy to see how a young person can\\nbecome overwhelmed with their lives.\\n \\nQ: Will I get a mental illness if my brother or sister has one?\\nA: Although having a brother or sister with a mental illness puts you at higher risk for developing a mental illness,\\nit doesn’t mean that you will get one. What it does mean, is that you need to take care of yourself. If you start\\nfeeling sad or anxious or have other symptoms that are upsetting, you need to talk to someone you trust to help\\nyou ﬁgure out what is going on. We all have these feelings sometimes but if they continue for more than two\\nweeks it is important to let someone know.\\n \\nQ: My sister hurts herself on purpose. Why does she do this?\\nA: Sometimes people with mental illness are in such pain that they use unhealthy ways to cope. This can mean\\nhurting themselves on purpose. The good news is that with the help and support of family, friends and\\nprofessionals, they can ﬁnd new healthier ways to manage their mental illness and diﬃcult feelings. Even though it\\nmight be upsetting for you to know your sister hurts herself, try and be patient with her. Talk to someone you trust\\nto discuss how you’re feeling about it.\\n \\nQ: Why did my brother or sister have to go into the hospital?\\nA: Although it may seem like a pretty scary place to be, sometimes it is the best place for youth if they are not able\\nto keep themselves safe. Having someone you care about in the hospital is never fun, but it can be even more\\nupsetting for the families of young people admitted to a psychiatric unit. Just remember that the kids you may see\\non the unit are just like your brother or sister. They’re also trying to get better to go home to their family and\\nfriends. Try and be as supportive as possible to your brother at this time.\\n \\nQ: Will my brother or sister be diﬀerent once they are better?\\nA: We all change and grow over time, especially when we have had something important happen to us, like\\nexperiencing a mental illness. Even so, your brother or sister should mostly be the same as before they got sick.\\nYou might even notice positive changes. Youth can learn to cope with diﬃcult situations by learning ways to better\\ntake care of themselves when things get tough.\\n \\nQ: How long does mental illness last?', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Mental Illness_ Information for Siblings.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

It is an easy concept to grasp quickly; it is nonetheless a skill that takes time and\\npractice to develop. The beneﬁts of mindfulness are many, including better emotional and\\nphysical health, better relationships and improved productivity. “Pay attention to what you are\\ndoing. When your attention wanders, bring it back to what you are doing. Repeat one billion\\ntimes.”\\nWhat is Mindfulness?\\nMindfulness means paying attention to what’s happening right now. When you practice mindfulness, you turn your\\nattention to your thoughts, emotions and body sensations in the present moment. While doing this, you do your\\nbest to accept what you’re experiencing without labelling it as ‘good,’ ‘bad,’ or anything else. This can help you\\nfeel calmer and cope better with stress and frustration.\\nMindfulness includes ‘formal mindfulness’ such as doing meditation or yoga. Mindfulness also includes anything we\\ndo where we are focused on the present, such as going for a walk, cleaning, or having a meal.\\nFocusing on the present helps us to:\\n \\n• Feel less depressed – as we often do when we worry about the past\\n• Feel less anxious – as we often do when we worry about the future\\n \\n“Right here, right now\\nThere is no other place I want to be”   \\n-- Jesus Jones\\nHow Can Mindfulness Help Me?\\nResearch studies show that mindfulness can:\\nPromote mental well-being.\\nHelp us calm our minds and relax.\\nHelp us handle our emotions.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Mindfulness 101_ The Basics.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Or do you tend to...\\n❏ observe life as it happens ❏  analyze and judge\\n❏ accept how you are feeling ❏  feel bad about how you feel\\n❏ focus on the present ❏  focus on the past/future\\nHow Can I Be More Mindful?\\nIn today’s world, it’s not always easy to keep our minds in the present moment. Our attention often gets pulled\\naway by many things, including our devices or other technology. So we end up not giving our full attention to what\\nwe’re doing or the people we’re with. Or we dwell in the past or worry about the future. Our minds are constantly\\njumping from one thing to the next. Mindfulness teachers say this is our ‘monkey mind.’ It’s like our mind is ﬁlled\\nwith monkeys, all jumping, chattering and screeching to get our attention. Practicing mindfulness can help us to\\ntame our ‘monkey mind.’ This might seem hard to do at ﬁrst, but it really can be simple and easy.\\n \\nYou can practice mindfulness in everyday activities or try more formal mindfulness exercises (sometimes called\\n‘mindfulness meditation).\\n \\nHere are some steps to guide you on your path.\\nParticipate fully\\nTry to: Bring your full attention to what you’re doing, e.g. “Let’s keep phones away from the dinner\\ntable so we can talk to each other.\\nTry not to: Do many things at the same time, e.g. multi-tasking while talking with loved ones. \\nReﬂect\\nTry to: Observe your thoughts, emotions and body sensations with open curiosity, e.g. “My muscles\\nare tense, and I\\'m feeling annoyed.”\\nTry not to: Judge the experience (as good, or bad or anything else), or act on your feelings right\\naway, e.g. \"This is terrible, I can\\'t relax, I\\'ll never succeed!\"\\nRecognize\\nTry to: Remind yourself that your thoughts, emotions and body sensations are just thoughts,\\nemotions or sensations. These don’t always reﬂect the whole truth and can change from moment to\\nmoment. Focus on what you are observing or feeling, e.g. \"It feels like no one loves me right now --\\n but this happens when I\\'m tired and I know I\\'ll feel better after a good night sleep.\"\\nTry not to: Turn your emotions and thoughts into facts. \\nAccept\\nTry to: Accept what you’re experiencing without judgment, e.g. \"I\\'m sad. My chest feels tight, and I\\nfeel like crying.\"\\nTry not to: Judge your experience or think about your thoughts, feelings and body sensations as\\n‘good,’ ‘bad,’ ‘right,’ or ‘wrong.’ \\nRe-focus\\nTry to: Notice when your thoughts wander, then gently bring your awareness back to the present\\nmoment. Take a mindful pause.\\nE.g. \"My thoughts are wandering -- okay, let\\'s try to focus some more, maybe I need a break!\"\\nTry not to: Judge yourself harshly when this happens.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Mindfulness 101_ The Basics.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Page 3 / 6\\nBe kind to yourself\\nTry to: Respond to your thoughts, emotions and body sensations with a gentle and compassionate\\nattitude towards yourself, e.g.  “I'd be kind to a friend who felt this way. I'd tell her to take care of\\nherself. I should be as kind to myself as I would to my friend.”\\nTry not to: Criticize yourself for not being better. After all, would you be as hard on a friend or loved\\none?\\nInformal and Everyday Mindfulness\\nThere are many ways to be more mindful in our busy lives. No matter what you’re doing, you can bring your full\\nattention to it. It is easier to do this with things we enjoy, but even the boring, mundane moments are an\\nopportunity for mindfulness. Let yourself just be into it.\\n \\nWaking up. As you wake up in the morning, lie in bed and pay attention to what you are:\\nSeeing – the sun, clouds, trees and grass outside the window\\nHearing – birds chirping.\\nSmelling – fresh air from outside the window\\nFeeling – warm bedsheets.\\nIn the shower, try noticing: \\nAs you shower, notice the steam rising, the sound of water, the scent of soap, the sensation of warm water\\non your body.\\nCooking. Focus on:\\nThe feeling of food in your hands as you mix, peel, chop, wash.\\nThe colour, texture and smell of the food you’re preparing.\\nHow foods change as you fry, grate, whip and boil.\\nEating. When eating, try to: \\nTurn oﬀ all devices.\\nLook at your food. Notice the colour, texture and smell. Take a bite and chew slowly. Is it hot? Cold? Lumpy?\\nSweet? Salty? Does the taste change as you chew? How does it feel when you swallow? When do you start\\nto feel full?\\nStudies show that mindful eating helps people enjoy their food more and helps prevent overeating (which\\ncan thus help people lose weight). \\nCleaning\\nCleaning can be meditative and mindful. Unfortunately, many people try to rush through cleaning, focusing\\non the result. Mindful cleaning is where cleaning is simply about cleaning. Set aside time for cleaning. Turn\\noﬀ the phone and any background distractions. And while you clean, use the opportunity to practice\\nmindfulness.\\nMindful dishes: While washing the dishes, be aware of your breathing; the temperature of the water on your\\nhands—practice gratitude by being grateful that you have dishes and the meals that have gone with them.\\nMindful sweeping: Sweeping lends itself well to mindfulness and forms an important meditative practice for\\nJapanese monks, who may sweep several hours a day. You can do the same thing with sweeping or any\\ncleaning activity. Imagine you are sweeping or cleaning out negative energy, allowing positive energy to ﬁll\\nits place. Consider a mantra with every movement, “May I be at peace.”\\nMindful laundry folding: While folding the laundry, be aware of all your senses, such as the temperature of\\nthe clothes, the textures, the smells. Practice gratitude by being grateful for the fact you have clothes and\\nthe service that they have provided for you\\nOutside. When outside, pay attention to:\\nThe colours around you - yellow leaves, white snow, grey slush, blue sky, dark clouds.\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Mindfulness 101_ The Basics.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Try to avoid reading emails ﬁrst thing in the morning. Your\\nmind is the most focused and creative in the morning. This is the best time to focus on your priorities and\\nthe most challenging work. When you answer emails ﬁrst thing, you get distracted by other people’s\\npriorities. Aim to give yourself 30 to 60 minutes before trying to catch up on emails. Try to check and\\nrespond to email just a few times each day, at set times.\\n \\nManage distractions. Close your door, turn oﬀ the radio, and disable notiﬁcations. Fewer distractions will\\nallow you to really focus on what you’re doing. Do you work in a cubicle environment? Listening to white\\nnoise or classical music through headphones may help block out distractions.\\n \\nDon’t multitask. Studies show that everyone does better on tasks when they can focus on one task and\\ncomplete it. Even people who think they are good at multitasking are actually more eﬃcient when they\\nfocus on one thing at a time.\\nHow To Be Mindful:  Formal Mindfulness\\nFormal mindfulness deliberately takes time to focus attention on something speciﬁc, like the breath, sound, or\\nbody sensations. You can practice for 30 seconds to 45 minutes or more. When your mind wanders (and it will),\\ngently bring your attention back to the breath. When starting, you may ﬁnd it helpful to follow guided mindfulness\\nexercises available online. We’ve included links to some of these in the resource section.\\n \\nHere are some ways to practice formal mindfulness:\\n \\nAwareness of the breath\\nSit down in a comfortable position.1.\\nBring your awareness to your breath. Notice how your chest and belly move with each breath, how your2.\\nnostrils feel as the air moves in and out.

When you practice mindfulness, you turn your\\nattention to your thoughts, emotions, body sensations and experience in the present moment. While doing this,\\nyou do your best to accept what happens, without labelling it as ‘good’, ‘bad’, or anything else. This can help you\\nfeel calmer and respond in more helpful ways.\\nHow can I be a more mindful parent?\\nIt’s not always easy to keep our minds in the present moment. Our attention often gets pulled away by many\\nthings. So we end up not giving our full attention to what we’re doing or the people we’re with. We may dwell in\\nthe past, worry about the future or get distracted by our smartphones. Our minds jump from one thing to the next.\\nMindfulness teachers say this is our ‘monkey mind’. It’s like our mind is ﬁlled with monkeys, all jumping, chattering\\nand screeching to get our attention. We can tame our ‘monkey minds’, but it takes practice. Here are some things\\nto work on:\\n \\nListen with your full attention. Try to:\\nGive your full attention to your child or teen.\\nListen with more than your ears. Facial expressions, tone of voice and body language are also very\\nimportant.\\nNotice what happens when you judge what your child or teen tells you, or when you give advice without\\nbeing asked for it.\\nAccept yourself and your child or teen. Try to:\\nAccept your children as they are, without judging their feelings, abilities, qualities or behaviour.\\nReﬂect on your hopes and desires for your children: are you wishing them to be diﬀerent than they are?  \\nBring your expectations in line with your child ot teen’s age and abilities.

Make meals, work on hobbies, crafts,\\nor chores. Play outside or bring out a board game.\\n \\nBring your ‘best self’. Do your best to manage your stress in positive ways, so that you bring your best to\\nyour family.\\n \\nBeware of multi-tasking. Try to focus on doing one thing at a time, more often. We are actually more\\nproductive and less stressed when we turn our attention to just one activity. Help your children to do the\\nsame. For example:\\nAt mealtimes, focus on the food and the people around the table. Leave all devices in another room,\\nand don’t have the TV on in the background.\\nAs much as possible, have children and youth do school work without music or devices. For youth\\nwho feel they need some sound while they work, try classical music or sounds from nature (water\\nrunning, birdsong).\\nTake a walk outside without headphones.\\n \\nLimit screen time. Too much time in front of computers, TVs and devices squeezes out time for important\\nthings, like active play, hobbies and connecting with others face to face. Some video games, or too much\\ntime playing them, can overload the senses.\\n \\nFocus on feelings. Help your children to notice and name their feelings. Help them understand that all\\nfeelings come and go. And they sometimes change quickly.

Instead of just watching, give children and youth chances to be active players:\\nsinging, dancing, playing music, drawing, painting, or building.\\n \\nEnjoy the great outdoors. Being outside near trees, lakes or rivers is always calming. Watch the sun rise and\\nset, Stare at the clouds, moon and stars. Help children tune in to their senses: ask about what they see,\\nhear and smell.\\n \\nAwaken the senses and get dirty. Play with ﬁnger paint, water, sand, clay, mud and dirt. Plant seeds and\\nwatch them grow into ﬂowers and vegetables.\\nMindful parenting in action\\nYou’ve had a busy day at work, and now have to catch up on email at home. Your kids are playing close by.\\n \\nTheir voices start to rise. Now they’re yelling at each other. By the time you get up from your chair, your 3 year old\\nis crying, because your 5 year old has pushed him over.\\n \\nYou feel your anger rising - why can’t they get along? Why do they always seem to do this when you’re really busy\\nand already stressed? You’re about to start yelling too.\\n \\nThen... you take a moment. And a deep breath. You notice your angry and frustrated feelings. You notice that you\\nalso resent having to bring work home. And you remember that your kids are still pretty young, and just learning to\\nwork out conﬂicts and deal with their own frustration.\\n \\nYou take another breath, and say, as calmly as you can:\\n“Whoa! What’s going on here?” \\nAfter giving both kids a chance to explain, helping them to speak calmly, you show thow you’ve really understood\\nthem by repeating what they’ve told you:\\n“I see. So Ari wanted to help, but  you were afraid he’d break the house you were building. You’ve worked\\nreally hard on it. But Ari really wanted to play too. He got angry, and pushed your house over. Then you got\\nangry, and pushed Ari over. Everybody’s pretty upset and frustrated. It’s OK to feel upset. But it’s not OK to\\nbreak people’s houses, or to push people over. Let’s take a minute to calm down together.” \\nYou sit on the sofa with one on each side of you, and have a little cuddle. When everyone’s calmer, you say:\\n“OK - so let’s ﬁgure out what to do when Ben wants to build by himself, but Ari wants to help him.” \\nYou listen, and help each child express himself calmly to the other. You try to help them them come up with a\\nsolution, instead of solving the problem for them. And you don’t force them to play together, “be nice’, or\\napologize.\\n \\nAnd if you lose your temper at times - be kind and forgiving to yourself. You’re human, and parenting is the\\ntoughest job there is. Take a deep breath, and start again :-)\\nReferences\\nBurke, C. A. (2010).

Being around other people (especially during mealtimes) becomes\\nvery stressful. It can be hard for people without misophonia to understand how distressing this\\nis. Misophonia is a condition where a person’s brain is wired diﬀerently for sound. It is not due to\\nthem purposely trying to be diﬃcult or controlling. The good news is that many strategies,\\nservices and supports can help, such as audiologists and using white noise.\\nM’s Story\\nM. is in her teens and is so distressed by the sounds of family members eating or breathing that she can no longer\\ntolerate meals with her family. Her family can’t understand why she can’t just have dinner like everyone else.\\nIs This You?\\nDo you get upset, irritated or very angry when you hear people:\\nEating or chewing with their mouths open?\\nSniﬄing?\\nTyping on a keyboard?\\nMaking other soft sounds that don’t seem to bother anyone else?\\nIf so, you may have misophonia.\\nWhat is Misophonia?\\nMany of us have had the experience of hearing sounds that make us feel uncomfortable.\\nFor example:\\nThe sound of ﬁngernails scraping across a chalkboard makes many people cringe.\\nSirens or smoke alarms make our hearts beat faster.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Misophonia_ When Ordinary Sounds Are Overwhelming.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Page 2 / 8\\nBeing aware of certain sounds and reacting strongly to them may have been very helpful to early humans. This\\nhelped our ancestors survive by alerting them to possible dangers.\\nHowever, in misophonia, people are so sensitive to certain sounds, that it causes stress.\\nTop Misophonia Sound Triggers\\nTop triggers for those with misophonia (Schröder, 2013):\\nEating sounds (81% of those with misophonia)\\nLoud breathing or nose sounds (64% of those with misophonia)\\nFinger or hand sounds (59% of those with misophonia)\\nInterestingly, humans make most of the sounds and sights that trigger misophonia. A dog slurping down a bowl of\\nfood or similar does not usually provoke a misophonic reaction.\\nWhen a person with misophonia hears a trigger sound, these sounds trigger the person’s ﬁght/ﬂight response.\\nThey may feel intense dislike, sensitivity, distress, fear, stress, anger and even rage.\\nFamily and friends may ﬁnd misophonia hard to understand. Since they don’t have the same problem, they\\ntypically have trouble understanding why the person is upset by sound. \\nThey may express their frustration and lack of understanding by saying things such as, “Just get over it!” or “Stop\\nbeing so sensitive!” “Stop being so controlling!”\\nVisual triggers aka. Misokinesia\\nMisokinesia (literally, “hatred of movement”) is when a person is triggered by seeing someone repeating speciﬁc\\nphysical actions, such as those originally associated with misophonia sound triggers.\\nFor example:\\nA person triggered by the sound of tapping may become triggered by simply seeing someone tapping their\\nﬁngers, even if they cannot hear any tapping.\\nTerms \\nMisophonia means “hatred of sound.” It is also known as selective sound sensitivity syndrome (“4S”).\\nRelated Conditions\\nMisophonia is part of a group of sound tolerance diﬃculties (decreased sound tolerance).\\nOther conditions in this group are\\nHyperacusis: Extreme sensitivity to all sounds in general (for example, normal sounds seem too loud).\\nPhonophobia: Fear of certain sounds.\\nTinnitus is often also seen in people with misophonia. Tinnitus is when people experience ringing or other noises\\n(such as roaring, clicking, buzzing) in one or both of their ears when there is no sound, which is why others cannot\\nhear everything.\\nSensory processing problems are often also seen in people with misophonia. Examples include\\nTouch or tactile hypersensitivity, where people become distressed by touch;\\nVisual stress, where people may have distress with light such as ﬂuorescent lights;\\nSmell and oral sensitivity, where people may be hypersensitivity to smells, tastes or food textures.\\nHow Common is Misophonia?\\nAbout 3% of the general population has misophonia (Jastreboﬀ, 2014).\\nMost people report their symptoms start in their ‘tweens', around age 9-12.\\nWhat’s Happening in Misophonia?\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Misophonia_ When Ordinary Sounds Are Overwhelming.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Page 3 / 8\\nStep 1: In misophonia, the person's ears work normally at hearing sounds.\\nStep 2: However, when the sounds are processed by the brain, they appear to trigger the limbic\\nsystem, turning on the 'ﬁght/ ﬂight’ alarm system. People report feeling upset, to the point of being\\nirritable, afraid or angry.\\nWhat Causes Misophonia?\\nMisophonia also appears to occur more commonly in people with certain conditions such as\\nSensory processing problems aka sensory processing disorder (SPD)\\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD);\\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD);\\nObsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).\\nBrain injury.\\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\\nQ. I get really stressed when my sister chews (especially when she chews salad), but it doesn’t happen with other\\npeople. Is it still misophonia?\\nA. Yes, people often report that their misophonia starts with just one person or just one sound and then progresses\\nfrom there.\\nQ. I am super sensitive to my family’s chewing sounds. However, I also ﬁnd that other sounds are too loud when\\nthey reach a certain level. Is that normal?\\nA. Yes, your sensitivity to the family’s chewing sounds would be misophonia. Sensitivity to other sounds is known\\nas hyperacusis, which is sensitivity to sounds in general especially loud sounds. People can have both.\\nQ. Is it okay to wear musician ﬁlters, hearing protection or noise-cancelling headphones without music to deal with\\nmy misophonia?\\nA. On the one hand, wearing things to block out the sounds will lead to relief in the short run. Do this if you are\\noverwhelmed. On the other hand, blocking sound may not help in the long run and can make you more sensitive to\\nmisophonia sounds when you do not have your headphones on. Audiologists recommend a system of gradually\\nincreasing white noise, pleasant background sound or music to help your brain get used to sounds.\\nQ. I heard that a white noise machine could help with misophonia. Is that true?\\nA. Yes, white noise can be helpful. Some people like white noise, and some people ﬁnd it overwhelming. Listen to\\nyour brain. If the white noise machine is enjoyable, use it! If not, a household item that makes a similar noise like a\\nfan might work. Try having a fan on and seeing if the sound it makes is more enjoyable or tolerable.

Explain that it is because your brain is wired diﬀerently for sound. You cannot simply choose not\\nto get upset by sounds, just like people can’t choose to stop having seizures or asthma.

Have white noise at mealtimes to\\ndrown out the chewing, e.g. nature sounds, restaurant ambient noise, etc.\\nIs it the sound of a co-worker tapping? Perhaps headphones to listen to music, a white noise\\ngenerator, or hearing protection headphones.\\nIs it your partner’s typing? Get them a quieter keyboard or a keyboard cover.\\nBackground and white noise\\nTry to work up to background sound around 24 hours a day, 7-days a week, to help your brain habituate.\\nBackground sound will help reduce the stress from trigger sounds. The background sound does not have to\\nbe loud. It just has to be at a comfortable level that you can tolerate, which can vary depending on your\\nday.\\nWays to have background sound\\nWhite noise app or audio tracks through your headphones or tabletop speaker.\\nWhite noise. Some people prefer nature-based white noise, e.g. the sound of heavy rain, whereas\\nothers prefer ‘artiﬁcial white noise’, e.g. static, or the sound of a fan, humidiﬁer, or aromatherapy\\ndiﬀuser.\\nDistraction\\nHave you been triggered by a sound?

It was originally known\\nas tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) and was used to help people with tinnitus. As the protocol can be hard to do on\\nyour own, it is best to have the help of a professional, if possible.\\nEarly steps\\nMake sure that you are never in silence by ensuring that you are always listening to pleasant, tolerable\\nbackground sounds, which habituate the brain to sound.\\nDo activities that you enjoy which involve sound, which helps the brain to rewire itself to associate the\\nsound with pleasant situations.\\nLater steps\\nCombine pleasant background sounds with triggering sounds to help reduce the response to trigger sounds\\n(Jastreboﬀ, 2014).\\nThe classic protocol has four steps:\\nStep 1 - Listen to sounds while you have full control.\\nYou have complete control over the type of sound, how loud and how long you listen to it.\\nIdentify and choose some pleasant sounds such as\\nNature sounds,\\nListening to music, such as spa music, relaxation music or instrumental music.\\nShopping in a mall.\\nBeing at a coﬀee shop\\nListen to this sound at a comfortable level (this could be barely audible), and while listening to these\\npleasant sounds AND... \\n... While listening to the sound from above, do an activity you enjoy like painting, being in the bath, getting\\na massage, doing yoga, stretching, colouring in a colouring book, sculpting .\\nIn the ﬁrst week\\nListen once or twice a day for 20-40 minutes.\\nChange the sound as needed for comfort. Ensure your choice of sound is relatively stable, not\\nchanging volume signiﬁcantly.\\nOver the next weeks\\nGradually increase the volume. If this causes too much distress, then back it down again.\\nStep 2 - Listen to sounds where another person has partial control.\\nAre you able to tolerate sound that you are in complete control over?\\nIf so, do the same activities with your selected type of sound AND ask a trusted person to set the\\nvolume level to something they think you can tolerate.\\nAfter an agreed amount of time, you give feedback as to the level of the sound they set.

However at this step, let them turn\\nthe volume up or down without considering your feedback.\\nThis trains your brain to tolerate noise you have no control over or how to cope with such situations.\\nIs the noise too much for you? Make sure you know you have an exit strategy if it becomes too much\\n(leaving the room without making sure that is ok with your listening partner).\\nStep 4 - Introduce unpleasant sounds\\nWhile enjoying your controlled sound and activity environment, brieﬂy and softly introduce the sounds that\\nyou dislike, like chewing noise or tapping.\\nOver time and listening sessions, gradually increase this exposure by increasing the occurrence and\\nduration.\\nHave your partner keep a journal to ensure that exposure is not happening too rapidly. This step can also\\ntake weeks or months.\\nAt ﬁrst, the pleasant sound could hide the unpleasant or trigger sound. Over the following weeks, decrease\\nthe pleasant sound or increase the unpleasant sound, still while doing something that you enjoy.\\nOther Treatments for Misophonia\\nMental health apps\\nDozier Trigger Tamer App, is a mobile application created by Thomas Dozier of the Misophonia Treatment Institute\\n(misophoniatreatment.com).

People with narcolepsy can have irresistible\\nsleep attacks where they end up falling asleep at school, work, and in public places, which can\\ncause severe problems with all aspects of life. The good news, is that eﬀective treatments exist.\\nCase\\nJennifer is in her 20’s and has extreme problems with sleepiness. This is extremely frustrating, because when\\nyounger, she was extremely active and athletic. Nowadays however, no matter how much sleep she gets at night,\\nshe is always exhausted. The sleepiness is so bad that she’ll fall asleep on public transit, and even while talking\\nwith friends. It is so bad that she couldn’t ﬁnish high school, and hasn’t been able to keep any job due to her\\nfatigue and inability to wake up on time for work. She has seen doctors and been tested for hormone, vitamin\\ndeﬁciencies and diet issues, but no one has found anything.\\nCould I Have Narcolepsy?\\nDo you:\\nFeel excessive sleepiness all the time, even when you have gotten an appropriate amount of sleep in the\\nnight?\\nFind that if you experience strong emotions (e.g. someone tells you something funny, surprised, angry or\\nsad), your muscles get weak?

(e.g. bugs on the walls, hearing voices)\\nEver feel paralyzed when waking or falling asleep?\\nIf you have answered YES to more than a few questions, read on because you might have narcolepsy…\\nWhat is Narcolepsy?\\nNarcolepsy is a sleep disorder where people may notice:\\nExcessive daytime sleepiness: It can range from mild “mental cloudiness” to irresistible sleepiness that\\nmakes it impossible to function.\\nUnrefreshing sleep: Even when they appear to get what seems to be enough hours of sleep, it is not\\nrefreshing. And despite feeling sleepy throughout the day, people have poor night-time sleep, with repeated', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Narcolepsy and Cataplexy.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 5\\nawakenings, sometimes with vivid dreams. “A whole night’s sleep can feel like a ﬁve minute nap -- and a\\nﬁve-minute nap can feel like a whole night’s sleep.”\\nUncontrollable “sleep attacks”: Sleep attacks are irresistible urges to sleep, and one simply falls asleep\\nduring any activity, at anytime during the day. Understandably, this can cause severe problems with school,\\nwork and home life.\\nIn addition, people may also have:\\nCataplexy: Sudden brief episodes of muscle weakness that occur with a strong emotional trigger. Triggers\\ninclude laughter, surprise, anger, extreme happiness or sadness. Examples of muscle weakness include\\nknees buckling, or the head drooping, or even speech becoming slurred because of an inability to move\\nmuscles necessary for speech. Some people experience full-body episodes where they are unable to move\\nor verbally communicate. These attacks last from a few seconds to several minutes. People may fall to the\\nground because of the knees buckling, misleading some observers to believe that the person has fainted or\\nhad a seizure, but unlike these disorders, consciousness is maintained throughout the spell. Cataplexy is\\nthought to be related to the muscle paralysis of REM sleep intruding abnormally in wakefulness. Up to 70%\\nof those with narcolepsy have cataplexy, which can manifest together with daytime sleepiness, or develop\\nlater, even 5-10 years after sleepiness occurs. Cataplexy is very speciﬁc to narcolepsy -- it is rarely seen in\\nthose without narcolepsy.\\nSleep paralysis: Periods where one feels suddenly unable to move, or speak, or sometimes even breathe for\\nseconds or minutes, though it often feels much longer. It can be a terrifying experience, and usually occurs\\noften upon awakening from sleep, or just before sleep. The paralysis is thought to be REM muscle paralysis\\nintruding upon wakefulness. Most people with narcolepsy (i.e. 60%) will experience this symptom, but this\\ncan also occur in those without narcolepsy.\\nHallucinations: Vivid and frightening hallucinations, e.g. seeing bugs on the walls, or hearing noises in the\\nhome. People often worry that they are going “crazy” and are worried to mention these symptoms.\\nHallucinations may happen upon falling asleep (hypnagogic), or upon awakening from sleep (hypnopompic).\\nThese are also thought to be examples of REM sleep (in this case dream content) intruding upon\\nwakefulness. Up to 60% of those with narcolepsy have these experiences, often frightening. People without\\nnarcolepsy sometimes have sleep paralysis and/or hypnagogic / hypnopompic hallucinations especially if\\nthey are extremely sleep deprived. These people, however, will not have cataplexy.\\nAs a result, narcolepsy can cause signiﬁcant problems with all aspects of life including school, work, relationships\\nand home life.\\nHow Common is Narcolepsy?\\nNarcolepsy aﬀects approximately 1 in 2000 people (0.05% of the population). Symptoms can start at any age.\\nUsually symptoms start in childhood to teenage years.\\nNarcolepsy is often unrecognized and undiagnosed\\nUnfortunately, studies suggest that most (about 90%) of those with narcolepsy are not diagnosed.\\nThose with untreated narcolepsy struggle with functioning at school, work and home. They are at a high risk of\\nbeing ﬁred or getting into motor vehicle accidents. As a result, they are at a high risk of developing stress, anxiety\\nand depression.\\nEven when people see health professionals, they are often misdiagnosed or told they are lazy and inattentive, or\\nthat they have conditions such as epilepsy, substance use problems, attention deﬁcit disorder, depression, anxiety\\nor even schizophrenia. These stigmas can often continue to persist by friends, family and colleagues after\\ndiagnosis.\\nEven if patients receive a diagnosis, they often struggle for an average of 10 or more years before symptoms are\\nidentiﬁed and diagnosed.\\nWhat Causes Narcolepsy?\\nNarcolepsy is most likely an autoimmune disorder. It may start with a viral infection, or other stress on the body’s\\nimmune system. In certain cases, the body’s immune system ends up attacking the brain cells that produce\\nhypocretin (aka orexin), which is a neurotransmitter involved in sleep. As a result, the brain lacks hypocretin, and', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Narcolepsy and Cataplexy.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Your doctor will help ensure\\nthat your symptoms of sleepiness and fatigue are not due to other causes, such as insuﬃcient sleep,\\ninconsistent sleep schedule, anemia, thyroid issues, diabetes, or other medical conditions.\\nSleep testing: If appropriate, your primary care provider might refer you for testing at a sleep clinic. The\\nmain test for narcolepsy is a test called the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) that is performed after an\\novernight sleep study (PSG or polysomnogram). The MSLT is a daytime test, where people are given 4-5\\nopportunities to have a nap (lasting up to 35 minutes), each separated by 2 hour intervals. Depending on\\nhow quickly you fall asleep, and whether or not you reach REM sleep, the physician can determine if you\\nhave narcolepsy.\\nHow is Narcolepsy and Cataplexy Treated?\\nFor narcolepsy, stimulant medications are used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness, such as:\\nModaﬁnil (Alertec),\\nMethylphenidate (Ritalin), or\\nDextroamphetamine (Dexedrine).\\nTreatment helps with managing daytime sleepiness, and preventing the REM sleep intrusion phenomena\\n(cataplexy, sleep paralysis and hallucinations) during wakefulness. \\nFor cataplexy, medications can be used such as:\\nSodium oxybate (sodium salt of gamma hydroxybutyrate, GHB), which is felt to be the most eﬀective. This\\nmedication has signiﬁcant potential for side eﬀects and requires special licensing privileges to prescribe.\\nAntidepressants, such as\\nVenlafaxine (Eﬀexor),\\nAtomoxetine (Strattera),\\nFluoxetine (Prozac)\\nBaclofen, an antispasmodic medication. It works in a similar way as sodium oxybate. Both baclofen and\\nsodium oxybate act to consolidate nighttime sleep to help with excessive daytime sleepiness in addition to\\ncataplexy.\\nThere is no cure for narcolepsy yet; however medications can be very successful with dealing with the symptoms.\\nResearch in narcolepsy are yielding exciting breakthroughs that continue to improve our understanding and\\ntreatment.\\nSelf-Help and Other Strategies for Narcolepsy\\nKeep a regular sleep-wake schedule;\\nDon’t stay up late, even on weekends;\\nAvoid alcohol and other central nervous system depressants;\\nTake intentional short naps (10-30 minutes) as needed to avoid unintentional sleep attacks;\\nUse modest amounts of caﬀeine to promote alertness as needed;\\nOperate motor vehicles and other heavy machinery only with the approval of your health care provider.\\nEducate parents, family and friends about narcolepsy.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Narcolepsy and Cataplexy.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

The good news is that there\\nis a single intervention that can help our children’s physical, mental and spiritual health all at\\nthe same time: spontaneous, unstructured outdoor play. There are many things we can do to\\nhelp get our kids outside so that they can do what kids used to do — and be happier and\\nhealthier for it.\\nIntroduction \\nAll parents want to raise happy, healthy children, but in spite of our best eﬀorts, many children and youth struggle\\nwith physical and mental health problems in today's world. \\n \\nThe good news is that there is an easy way to help our children’s and teens’ physical, mental and spiritual health... \\n...Spontaneous, unstructured outdoor play!\\nSpontaneous, unstructured outdoor play is letting kids be kids outdoors, creating on their own without adult\\ninterference. It means letting kids:\\nBe outdoors with fresh air, sunlight and the sounds of nature.  \\nUse their imaginations to do or create whatever they want, within reasonable safe limits.\\nTry out age-appropriate “risky” play, such as climbing trees, running fast or roughhousing. This allows kids\\nto test their own abilities and limits, making them safer in the long run. \\nSocialize face-to-face with peers. This gives kids important opportunities to learn and practice social skills.\\nFace-to-face contact, in particular, is important for kids’ brains to develop empathy.\\nEnjoy free play activities that do not have rules or referees, unlike organized sports.\\nSpontaneous outdoor play is:\\nGoing for a walk or hike\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Nature and Why It’s Essential For Kids’ Brains_ Information for Parents and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

This oﬀers fewer\\nopportunities to freely explore and be truly creative, and it becomes about competition and winning. \\nIt’s not playing indoors, because then there are no beneﬁts from sunlight and fresh air. \\nIt’s not playing indoors in front of a screen, because then there are no beneﬁts from interacting with the real\\nworld. \\nHow much nature do children/youth need?\\nAt least 60 minutes daily outside, based on various studies: \\nFor eye health, it’s recommended to have at least 10 hours/week outdoors (1½ hours outside every day). \\nFor spiritual health, studies show that 5 to 10 hours/week outside help kids to feel connected to nature (Van\\nWierem, 2013).\\nFor mental health, studies show that spending at least 30 minutes a week in a park helps improve mental\\nhealth — the more time spent in nature, the better (Shanahan, 2016).\\nHow much physical activity do children/youth need?  \\nAge Recommended amount of physical activity per day according to the Canadian Society for Exercise\\nPhysiology\\n3-4 years\\n 3 hours (180 minutes) daily, spread over the day\\n5-17 years\\n 1 hour (60 minutes) daily, spread over the day, with a combination of:  \\n● High energy activities (e.g., jogging, soccer, playing tag) at least 3 days a week\\n● Activities that build muscle and bone (e.g., hiking, dancing, swimming) at least 3 days a week\\n \\nLet your kids play outside and meet their need for nature and physical activity at the same time!\\nChildren connected with nature are:\\nHealthier:\\nTheir heart health is better because they move more, sit less and play longer.\\nThey have better eye health. Kids who spend at least 10 hours/week outside reduce their risk of\\nnearsightedness (myopia).  \\nThey sleep better because sunlight helps regulate sleep patterns.  \\nHappier:\\nImproved mood means less depression, anxiety and other mental health issues.\\nImproved social development comes from better communication skills that can lead to better\\nrelationships with others.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Nature and Why It’s Essential For Kids’ Brains_ Information for Parents and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Having\\nchildren and youth who care about the planet is essential for the survival of our planet and species.\\nReady for learning:\\nThe sights, smells and sounds of nature (‘pink noise’) are restorative for human nervous systems and\\nresult in better focus, concentration and creativity. Studies show that nature time reduces symptoms\\nof ADHD (Kuo, 2004). \\nDisadvantages of indoor play\\nSedentary lifestyle. Sitting around for long periods is particularly bad for children and youth and increases\\nthe risk of heart disease, diabetes, mental health problems and even some types of cancer.\\nOveruse of recreational screens such as TV and video games. Children who don’t get outdoors\\nenough may get too much screen time. This carries its own risks such as cyberbullying, online predators,\\ninappropriate sex and violence, mental health problems and sleep problems.  \\nExposure to bad air. Air quality indoors is often worse than outdoors. This increases exposure to allergens\\n(e.g., dust, mould, pet dander) and infectious diseases, and potentially leads to chronic conditions.\\nFeeling disconnected from Mother Earth.

Start when your kids are younger, so that as they grow older, they will just\\nnaturally understand that outdoor play is an important part of life. Family time is ideal for role modelling\\nactive outdoor pursuits like swimming, hiking or biking.  Let kids know that physical activity is “having fun\\noutside,” rather than “getting exercise” or “working out.”\\n ', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Nature and Why It’s Essential For Kids’ Brains_ Information for Parents and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

This could be the family walk after dinner, the family\\nhike on the weekend or the yearly family camping trip.\\n \\nAfter school, encourage your kids to get outside rather than sit in front of a TV. Many times kids\\nwill claim they want to “relax” by watching TV or playing a video game, but screen time tends to\\noverstimulate, not restore, the brain. On the other hand, time outside is restorative, even if it’s just sitting in\\na hammock in the shade. Save homework for after your child’s brain has had time to relax in nature.\\n \\nHave active instead of electronic activities. Instead of passive activities like family TV or movie nights,\\ntry to have more active, non-electronic activities like family board game nights or music nights (playing\\nmusic together, karaoke, etc.). Celebrate slow food by making your own pizza together or having a fondue.\\n  \\nPrepare for outdoor activities \\nBe prepared with a list of outdoor activities that are appropriate to your child’s physical skill level. For ideas,\\nvisit the ParticipACTION website: http://www.bringbackplay.ca/welcome/\\n \\nKeep a bag of your family’s favourite activity gear with items such as balls, a jump rope, bubbles, sidewalk\\nchalk and pylons. Keep the bag handy, for example in the car, so that you are ready to play at any time.   \\n \\nWhen buying gifts, choose items kids can play with outside such as balls, bikes and bubbles. Tell family\\nmembers not to get your kids electronic toys.  \\n \\nHave your kids wear clothing that is appropriate for the weather so they will be comfortable. Kids should be\\nencouraged to play outside in all kinds of weather, except the most extreme. \\nUse outdoor active play to meet emotional needs \\nPlay outside with your child to build and strengthen your relationship. \\n \\nChoose fun and challenging activities  that your child is able to do, thus building conﬁdence. Gradually\\nincrease the level of diﬃculty so that your child remains engaged.\\n \\nPlan outdoor play dates with other children so your child builds peer connections.\\n \\nGive your child opportunities to explore  on his or her own to build independence.\\nWhen kids are too closely supervised, they are less active. Go exploring with your child in nature, including\\nnearby forests, gardens or wild areas. Let kids decide how to explore —  which path to take or which tree to\\nclimb. Allow children to play without an adult hovering. Let your child decide what outdoor activities he or\\nshe likes to do, or let your child choose from a list. A child who makes his or her own choices will enjoy the\\nactivity more and stay outside longer. \\n \\nGive your child freedom as appropriate.  When children are younger, parents need to provide\\nsupervision but should not interfere unless necessary.  As children get older, letting them play around the\\nneighbourhood without a parent gives them the freedom to make choices within boundaries appropriate to\\ntheir age and abilities. This builds self-conﬁdence. \\n \\nMatch the activity to your child’s energy level.  Some kids prefer calm activities like walking; others\\nprefer high energy activities like mountain biking. Some children prefer individual or one-on-one activities,\\nand others prefer group activities. \\n \\nWalk the dog. Having a dog is great for getting family members outside for a daily walk. As kids get older,\\nthey can do this on their own. A pet can also help with children’s mood and self-acceptance. After all,\\nanimals like dogs provide unconditional acceptance. \\n \\nGive gratitude instead of praise.

Family routines that include outdoor time will help your child\\nunderstand that minimal screen time is normal and limiting it is not a punishment.\\n \\nIf your child or teen complains about going outside, it is even more important to limit screen\\ntime.  The high stimulation of screen time sets your child’s brain to get used to easy dopamine and\\nadrenaline. This causes your child to feel excited, energized and rewarded with very little physical eﬀort.\\nOnce your child’s brain gets used to the high stimulation from a video game, then being active outdoors will\\nbe less appealing. It requires far more eﬀort to run, climb, move or walk than simply sitting on the couch\\nand playing a video game. \\n \\nHelp your child enjoy the real world.  Instead of spending time on social media, get together with friends\\nor family to throw around a Frisbee. Instead of playing a video game, get the adrenaline rush from mountain\\nbiking.\\nDon’ts \\n \\nDon’t get ﬁtness trackers. Studies show that ﬁtness trackers don’t work. Perhaps this is because some\\nparents tend to pressure their child to achieve speciﬁc ﬁtness targets. This then makes it about\\nachievement and judgment and takes away the enjoyment. It can also hurt the relationship between the\\nchild and the parent. Other kids may  like the novelty of having a tracker, but that soon wears oﬀ. \\n \\nDon’t make the physical activity competitive , as competition involves judgment. Deep down, kids want\\nto feel accepted, not judged.\\n \\nDon’t rely mainly on external rewards or negative reinforcements  (including pressure or coercion)\\nas a way to motivate your child. It may appear to work in the short run, but it doesn't generally work in the\\nlong run. For example, try to avoid saying: “If you go play outside, we’ll go for ice cream / you can have\\nvideo game time / etc.”  Once the external rewards stop, the risk is that the behaviours stop as well.\\nInstead, just thank your child and express gratitude for his or her healthy choices. In the long run, the goal is\\nto help your child build self-motivation for healthy activities.\\nSpeciﬁc advice for parents of teens (13-18 years)\\nEncourage choice and independence . Give your teen the right to choose, but if your teen is unable to\\nmake healthy choices, then give your teen a choice among healthy options. \\n \\nSupport your teen so that he or she can do outside activities such as: \\n● Walking, hiking or biking\\n● Rollerblading or skateboarding, alone or with friends\\n● Non-competitive games of soccer, basketball, football or Frisbee \\nEncourage outdoor time as a break during overscheduled days. Teens can have many demands on their\\ntime, such as homework and extracurricular activities. Going with your teen for a quick walk outside is a\\ngreat way to restore energy. \\n \\nHelp your teens realize that no matter how attractive screens are, there is no replacement for face-to-face\\ncontact with another person, ideally outside. \\nTips for parents of children/youth with mental health issues\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Nature and Why It’s Essential For Kids’ Brains_ Information for Parents and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

However, it’s important to encourage outdoor time in nature for its\\ntherapeutic beneﬁts.\\nShow acceptance and appreciatio n towards your child/youth.\\n \\nGo outside with your child/youth. Don’t just tell your child to get outside, but go together. You might say\\nsomething like: “I really enjoy spending time with you. Let’s go for a walk to the park together. We can pack\\nsome food and have a picnic there.”\\n \\nSlowly introduce physical activities. Start with low energy activities like sitting outside, gardening, a\\nwalk around the block or sitting on a bench at the park. \\n \\nAvoid judgment.  Children/youth living with mental health challenges often feel disconnected physically or\\nemotionally from caring adults. If they feel they are being judged or criticized by an adult, this can make the\\nconnection worse. For example, telling your child who is struggling with depression to exercise more may\\nmake him or her feel judged or rejected. The child may not want to exercise anymore.\\n \\nDon’t go overboard with praise. The adult may view it as positive, but the child may view it as\\njudgment. Consider avoiding praise such as: “Good job at going outside today!”\\nInstead, use gratitude to show that you are happy with your child’s behaviour: “I had a wonderful time\\nwalking with you outside today. Thank you! I can’t wait until tomorrow so that we can do it again.”\\n \\nUse unconditional acceptance. Let your kids know that you love them no matter what. Show it through\\nyour actions of wanting to be with them, rather than showing disappointment if they don’t want to go\\noutside.\\nWhen to see a doctor \\nIf you are still struggling to get your child outside in spite of your best eﬀorts, consider seeing a doctor, especially if\\nyou notice any of the following: \\nDoes your child have severe problems with clumsiness and coordination, to the point it makes it hard for\\nyour child to want to go outside? Have you noticed frequent falls, bumps or injuries?\\nDoes your child struggling with social skills to the point it causes problems? \\nDoes your child have problems with sensory issues, for example, being hypersensitive to noise or touch?\\nAre there stresses in your relationship with your child, to the point where there are constant ﬁghts and\\ndisagreements?\\nIs your child’s connection to technology so strong that it gets in the way of your child connecting to other\\nthings such as people or the outdoors?  \\nA health professional can work with you to see if there are any conditions or issues that might be contributing to\\nyour child’s diﬃculties getting outside. Together you can come up with a plan.\\nIn conclusion\\nAccess to active play in nature and outdoors, along with all its risks, is essential for healthy child development.  We\\nmust all work together in our homes, schools and communities to increase opportunities for self-directed play\\noutdoors. Healthy, active outdoor play: it’s one of the single best hacks for physical and mental\\nhealth. \\nFor more information \\nWebsites\\n ', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Nature and Why It’s Essential For Kids’ Brains_ Information for Parents and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

The good news is that there are many strategies to\\nhelp people overcome their fear of needles.\\nJ’s Story, Part 1\\nJ. is a young adult who wants to get the COVID vaccine, because she wants to protect her elderly parents. And she\\nneeds to be vaccinated to keep her job working with medically ill people. But she has hated needles all her long\\nand she just doesn't know what to do...\\nIntroduction\\nOn one hand, getting needles for immunizations, bloodwork or injections is part of the miracle of modern medicine,\\nwhich helps people live healthier and longer than in the past. This includes getting needles for the COVID vaccine,\\nwhich is necessary for herd immunity to overcome the COVID pandemic.\\nOn the other hand, it is understandable that human beings might not want their skin pierced or hurt. This helps\\npeople be careful about avoiding cuts, bruises and injuries, and is helpful for survival. The need to keep our skin\\nintact is strongly wired into us, and explains why needle fears and phobias are so common.\\nTerms: Needle Fear vs. Phobia\\nFear of needles\\nFear of needles is very common in children and adults, and it is felt that it occurs in 25% of people.\\nHowever, most people are able to overcome their fear so that it does not stop them from getting\\nimmunizations, injections or blood work.\\nNeedle phobia\\nIn around 5-10% of people, the fear can be so great that it can prevent people from getting necessary\\nimmunizations, injections or blood work, at which point it is called a phobia (Craske, Antony, & Barlow, 1997;\\nKleinknecht, 1987; Mark, 1988).\\nAccording to the DSM-5 (Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), a tool used by professionals for\\ndiagnosis, needle phobia is a type of speciﬁc phobia.

It can aﬀect a person's medical health because it leads people to avoid getting\\nproper health care, such as being immunized against COVID. It can also cause signiﬁcant social problems when\\nimmunizations or testing are needed for work, health insurance, travel, education, and marriage.\\nWhat Causes Needle Phobia?\\nMany factors can contribute to a person’s fear of needles (Hamilton, 1995; Willemsen, 2002):\\nGenetics. Many people with needle phobia have relatives with needle phobia, which suggests a genetic\\nbasis.\\nLife events. Having a negative experience with needles may make you more likely to be fearful in the future.\\nWhat Happens During Needle Phobia?\\nThe person with needle phobia is exposed to a needle\\n↓\\nThe body's alarm system (i.e. autonomic nervous system) is activated, which leads to an increased heart rate and blood\\npressure.\\n↓\\nThe person may react in diﬀerent ways to avoid the perceived danger:\\n• Fight: Getting angry, irritable or aggressive.\\n• Flight: Running away, anxiety or fear.\\n• ‘Shut down’: The vasovagal reﬂex is activated, which causes a lowering of the heart rate and blood pressure. In some\\nindividuals, this vasovagal reﬂex is so extreme that the person may faint. In nature, most predators avoid eating dead\\nthings. Many organisms use this strategy to avoid predators, e.g. “playing possum” comes from the fact that the Virginia\\nopossum (aka possums) pretends to be dead when threatened.\\nWhat To Do About Needle Fears\\nStart with the CARD method, developed by Dr. Taddio in Toronto.\\nC)omfortable:\\nGet comfortable before and during the vaccination.\\nPractice self-compassion\\nBe nice to yourself, and say, “It’s okay to be anxious; everyone feels this way from time to time.”\\nTreat yourself to a snack before getting the vaccine.\\nWear clothing so that it’s easy to let people reach your upper arm (e.g. for the vaccine).\\nBring something that gives you comfort, e.g. wear comfy clothes, bring a nice warm blanket, bring a\\nfavourite stuﬃe.\\nBring a friend or family member along with you.\\nConsider numbing the skin beforehand so that it doesn’t hurt\\nEMLA Cream/ patches: You can purchase this at pharmacies.

Thus we can have too many of\\nsome types of brain waves or not enough of others.\\n \\nNeurofeedback is a type of therapy that can help individuals to better control their brain waves, which may thus be\\nhelpful for various brain conditions. \\nWhat is the Evidence for Neurofeedback?\\nEvidence suggests that neurofeedback may be useful for a variety of brain conditions, including:\\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (CADT, 2014; Hammond, 2015)   \\nADHD (Lofthouse, 2011; Moriyama, 2012) \\nNote however, that at this time, although neurofeedback appears to be promising, there is nonetheless a lack of\\nevidence for neurofeedback, particularly for mood and anxiety disorders (CADT, 2014).  \\nHow Does it Work?\\nNeurofeedback starts by seeing a professional with expertise in neurofeedback, such as a psychologist, for an\\nassessment.\\n \\nAs part of this assessment, it is usually recommended to do an electroencephalogram (EEG) assessment that\\ninvolves placing sensors on the patient’s scalp, and measuring the unique brain wave patterns of the patient.\\nBased on this EEG assessment, a custom treatment intervention can be developed.\\n \\nDuring treatment, sensors are placed on the patient’s scalp.

Since the brain is very adaptable (through plasticity), it\\ndoes not take long for the mind to start regulating itself so that the patient can succeed in the video game. As the\\nbrain develops more normal brainwave patterns, the patient’s symptoms start to improve.\\nHow Many Sessions?\\nDepending on the issue and what the assessment shows, patients usually train either twice a week for half an\\nhour, or once weekly for an hour.\\n \\nThe number of sessions is really dependent upon the person’s response and the complexity of the training\\nprotocol.\\n \\nLike learning any new skill, it takes time. In general, people should be prepared for 20 hours of treatment at a\\nminimum. Beneﬁts may appear after just a few sessions, but to make sure that the beneﬁts “stick”, it takes a bit\\nmore time.\\nWhat Parents Can Tell their Children/Youth\\nIf you are going to bring your child/youth to neurofeedback, this is what you can tell them:\\n \\nDo you have a moment? We have some really exciting news for you.\\n \\nThe bad news is that you’ve been having troubles with ____ (insert issue here, e.g. focusing, feeling anxious, etc.)\\n \\nHere’s the good news. There is a powerful way to help you with this, called neurofeedback.\\n \\nNeurofeedback is a really cool way of helping your brain be able to ____ (insert issue here, e.g. focus better, feel\\ncalmer (i.e. less anxiety), etc.\\n \\nHow does it work? There’s this neat video game you can play and as you ‘win’ in the video game it is teaching your\\nmind how to stay nice and calm. To do this, we will take you to a doctor that does neurofeedback. They will put\\nlittle sensors on your scalp using some sticky stuﬀ, and those sensors read your brain waves. Using the readings,\\nthey will make a video game for you. It’s a game that involves things like space ships or boats or a pac man.\\nWhat’s really cool is that you will learn to completely control whether or not the spaceship moves and wins. You\\ndon’t have any controllers to play this game. You get to play it with your mind! As you start to win at the game,\\nyour brain is learning how to stay calm so that you feel better.\\nOther Types of Biofeedback\\nNeurofeedback is a type of ‘biofeedback’. In addition to neurofeedback, there are other forms of biofeedback, such\\nas HeartMath (which regulates heart rate variability), thermal biofeedback, muscle biofeedback and other forms.\\nSome forms of these biofeedbacks can be purchased and delivered at home. A professional with expertise in\\nbiofeedback can help you determine which type of biofeedback might be the best for your child.\\nDo It Yourself Self-Regulating Activities\\nYou can also incorporate other activities and practices into life which can as a by-product help regulate their brain\\nand body.

The child is not truly\\nawake, and does not respond to others appropriately. Although scary, they are not dangerous or\\nharmful. Night terrors are due to an immature brain, and a child will grow out of them. During a\\nnight terror, parents can help ensure the child is kept safe, and be with the child until the child is\\nable to go back to sleep.\\nNeil’s Story\\nNeil is a 3-yo boy who lives with a loving family and enjoys going to his daycare. For the past year however, he’s\\nhad “night terrors”. He goes to bed, then has a blood curdling scream in the middle of the night, which has parents\\nquite worried.\\nWhat are Night Terrors?\\nNight terrors are a common sleep disorder seen in children (usually aged 3-5) that are not dangerous, and that\\nusually get better as the child gets older.\\nTerms\\nOther names include sleep terrors or pavor nocturnus.\\nWhat Does a Night Terror Look Like?\\nTypically, after going to sleep, the child wakes up with eyes wide open, looks of fear and panic, and may be\\nscreaming. Although the child’s eyes may be open, the child will not recognize others, nor will s/he be consolable.\\nNight terrors are more scary for the parent than the child.\\nDuring the episode, it is typically diﬃcult to wake up the child, and it is diﬃcult to comfort the child.\\nBecause waking up a child having a night terror can make s/he become more scared or agitated, it is usually better\\nto simply just ensure that s/he is safe, and let him/her return to sleep after it is over.\\nNight terrors occur most commonly in the ﬁrst third of the sleep cycle; typically lasts 5-30 minutes, and afterwards,\\nthe child returns to sleep.\\nAfterwards, the child typically (but not always) has no memory of the night terror.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Night Terrors and Sleep Terrors.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

When Do They Start?\\nEstimated to occur in 1-6% of children.\\nMost commonly in children between the ages of 2 and 6 years, but can occur at almost any age.\\nMay occur in adults. With adults, contributing factors may include stress and use of alcohol before bedtime, but not\\nalways.\\nWhat Causes it?\\nSleep is a complicated brain and body process, and it is felt that night terrors are a ‘malfunction’ of the normal\\nsleep cycle that occurs because the child’s brain is not yet fully developed.\\nIn addition, it may be triggered by:\\nStressful life events\\nFever\\nSleep deprivation or anything that aﬀects the child’s sleep (including sleep conditions such as sleep apnea)\\nCertain medications that the child is taking\\nChanges in the routine or schedule\\nBeing overtired\\nIs it a Night Terror or Nightmare?\\nNightmares can sometimes appear similar to night terrors, but there are distinct diﬀerences:\\nNight terror Nightmare\\nChildren usually do not recall having a night terror,\\nthough may recall a sense of feeling anxious, e.g. child\\nwill be unable to tell you what happened.More easily remembered, e.g. child will tell you, “I had a\\nnightmare that there was a monster chasing me! I want to\\nsleep in your bed tonight!”\\nUsually occurs in early part of night (i..e ﬁrst third of the\\nsleep cycle), about 1-4 hours after going to sleepUsually occurs during the later part of night (latter part of the\\nsleep cycle) during REM sleep and include unpleasant and\\nfrightening dreams.\\nUsually after a night terror, the child returns back to\\nnormal and falls back asleepAfter a nightmare, the child is typically scared and has a\\nharder time falling asleep\\nCould It Be Something Else?\\nAlthough very uncommon, certain types of epilepsy (aka seizure disorder) may also resemble night terrors such as:\\nTemporal lobe epilepsy: A person has brief episodes (30 sec to a few minutes) where they may experience:\\nmuscle contractions on the body/face; mouth movements; head movements, while seeing or hearing things,\\nalong with strong emotions.\\nNocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE): This is a type of seizure disorder that happens while the child is\\nsleeping. The child may assume a certain posture; have rhythmic, repetitive movements of the arms or legs;\\nrapid uncoordinated movements; wandering; pelvic thrusting; repetitive gestures; making sounds, along\\nwith feeling afraid.\\nCan You Grow Out of Night Terrors?\\nAs night terrors are felt due to an immature brain, they get better as the child’s brain matures, usually by age six.\\nNonetheless, some people continue to have night terrors as teens and even adults.\\nSelf-Help: What Parents Can Do About Night Terrors', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Night Terrors and Sleep Terrors.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 3 / 4\\nDuring the daytime\\nDo ensure that your house is safe, as you might for a child who sleepwalks, for example:\\nDo lock the doors at night so your child can’t get outside.\\nDo have safety gates to prevent your child from falling down the stairs.\\nDon’t tell your child about the night terrors. Your child will most likely have no recollection at all, nor is this\\nsomething your child can control, so telling your child about these usually does not help.\\nDon’t punish your child for having a night terror. Night terrors are due to your child’s brain, and it would\\nmake no sense to punish your child for having a brain that they inherited from their parents, especially one\\nthat your child had no choice over having.\\nDuring a Night Terror\\nDo observe and stay with your child. If its just occasional, isolated night terror, just observe your child, and\\nhold him/her until its over. Usually night terrors resolve quickly, and the child can go back to sleep.\\nDon’t panic. Night terrors, terrifying though they appear to others, are not dangerous or harmful per se.\\nDon’t wake your child\\nDon’t get angry or upset at the child for having a night terror. It can be frustrating to have a screaming child\\nthat doesn’t calm down, but getting upset or yelling back does not help.\\nFor a child who continues to have night terrors\\nDo have scheduled awakenings. If your child has a pattern of night terrors at a certain time, you can wake\\nup your child before the night terror. Because night terrors happen in the early phases of sleep, one way to\\ndisrupt them is to wake your child before the time that s/he has a night terror.\\nFigure out when your child’s night terrors usually happen. Then, gently wake up your child about 30-\\nminutes before the expected night terror. You might go into your child’s room, and gently wake them\\nwith a hug or a kiss. Keep your child awake (e.g. have your child sit up, talking with your child) for a\\nfew minutes before letting him/her go back to sleep.\\nDo support your child with stress. Although stress doesn’t cause night terrors per se, being under stress can\\nworsen night terrors, so dealing with stress is important.\\nHelp (your child) ﬁgure out what is stressful in his/her life. The usual stresses in a child’s life include\\nschool (teachers, schoolwork, peers, friends, bullies) and home (parents, siblings, and any other\\nfamily stresses like separation/divorce). Ask your child what bugs him/her.\\nCome up possible ways to deal with or reduce the stress.\\nDon’t let your child get overtired. Make sure that your child doesn’t get overstimulated, or overwhelmed\\nfrom too many activities. Make sure that you keep the same, usual regular bedtime routine so that your\\nchild can get enough rest.\\nDon’t shake or shout at your child. Night terrors are not your child being bad. Shaking or shouting doesn’t\\nwork and only makes your child more distressed.\\nDo You Suspect Night Terrors?\\nAre there symptoms of night terrors that are so severe that it is disrupting your child’s sleep (or aﬀecting the\\nfamily)?\\nIf so, then have your child seen by a primary care provider (e.g. family physician). Your primary care\\nprovider can help make sure that there aren’t any other medical problems (such as sleep condition or\\nepilepsy), as well as refer to any other specialists/professionals as needed.\\nAbout this Document\\nWritten by health professionals at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO).

It usually causes us to wake up feeling\\nupset and afraid. Most people have had nightmares, though they don’t happen often. The good\\nnews, is that most of the time they go away on their own. If they do not, there are many things\\nthat you can do to support your child/youth with nightmares.\\nWhat is a Nightmare?\\nA nightmare is a very distressing dream. It usually causes us to wake up feeling upset and afraid. Most people have\\nhad nightmares, though they don’t happen often. Nightmares are not real, but they can feel very real.\\nWhen Can Nightmares Become a Problem?\\nNightmares are never fun. But when they are severe and happen often, they can cause a lot of problems. Children\\nand youth can become fearful, anxious or depressed. Parents, caregivers and family members can lose sleep when\\na child or teen wakes from a nightmare. This can leave everyone tired all day.\\nWhat Causes Nightmares? \\nResearchers believe that nightmares are a complex mix of:\\nOur memories;\\nInformation we have come across recently;\\nVisual expressions of our feelings;\\nOther random information.\\nThe reason for a nightmare is diﬀerent for each person. Sometimes, nightmares happen for no reason at all. But\\nthere are some things that may contribute to nightmares, like:\\nStressful things that happen during the day (for example an important change or a relationship problem);\\nWatching scary movies or reading scary books before bedtime;\\nHigh fevers;\\nCertain medications;\\nPainful or frightening memories;\\nAnxiety or depression;\\nDiﬃculty falling asleep or staying asleep;', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Nightmares in Children and Youth.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Scary nightmares about bad things happening are caused by our fear of bad\\nthings happening. Nightmares are not telling us that something bad is about to happen.\\nCan’t hurt us. While they can be very scary, they can’t harm us.\\nAren’t all bad. Some people ﬁnd that nightmares can be exciting, and give them interesting ideas. For\\nexample, some writers and painters have been inspired by nightmares (Stephen King or Salvador Dali, for\\nexample).\\nCan We Prevent Nightmares?\\nYou can’t stop every nightmare. But there are many things can help, so that nightmares are not such a problem for\\nyour child or teen.\\nMake sure your child or teen is comfortable (bed, mattress, pillows, blankets).\\n \\nKeep the room slightly cool (as opposed to too warm).\\n \\nKeep a cup of water close by for children and youth who may need it.\\n \\nMake sure your child or teen gets help for problems with anxiety and depression (see resource list at the\\nend).\\n \\nReduce their stress by setting realistic expectations for children and youth, based on their age and abilities.\\n \\nHelp children and youth learn to handle stress in a positive way, and learn ways to calm themselves and\\nrelax (for children 4-8 years, see the MindMasters 2 resource in the resources section).\\n \\nLimit recreational screen time. Too much screen time overloads the mind and senses, making it harder to\\nrelax and sleep well. Aim for more time spent outside, or with electronic-free activities.\\n \\nMake sure your child or teen is getting enough physical activity (60 minutes of moderate activity every day).\\n \\nHave regular bed and wake up times, even on weekends.\\n \\nMake sure your child or teen is getting enough sleep.

       " Document(page_content='Page 3 / 5\\nHow Can I Help With My Child’s Nightmares?\\nHelp your child or teen to feel emotionally safe. A warm, close bond with your child or teen is the best place to\\nstart. Children and youth who feel safe will be generally content and happy, will talk to parents about how they\\nfeel, and will go to parents with problems or diﬃcult feelings.\\n \\nHelp children and youth feel emotionally safe by:\\nTreating them with warmth, aﬀection and age appropriate limits.\\n \\nHaving reasonable and age appropriate expectations.\\n \\nShowing children and teens you understand their feelings (for example, saying things like “that sounds very\\nscary” instead of “How can you let a dream upset you so much? You’re making such a big deal out of\\nnothing!”)\\n \\nAvoiding telling children they are ‘good’ or ‘bad’. Everyone needs to feel loved all the time, not just when\\nthey’re behaving well. To positively reinforce things, express gratitude. For example: “I saw you sharing\\nyour cookie. That made your sister very happy. Thank you for doing that!” “That is a very tall building you\\nmade!” “I really appreciate your help with the dishes!” Deal with misbehaviour in a calm voice, without\\nyelling. Focus on the behaviour, instead of telling your child she is ‘being bad’. Try to ‘connect’ before\\n‘correcting’. For example, “You don’t usually hit-were you feeling frustrated? What happened? Next time\\nthat happens, what can you do instead of hitting? What can you say to your sister if she takes your toy\\nagain? Can you tell me you’re upset, instead of hitting?”\\nIf your child or teen isn’t able to turn to you when she is worried, upset or afraid, it will help to ﬁnd out how to\\nimprove this.\\nOther Ways To Help\\nDecrease ‘blue’ light in the bedroom. Regular light bulbs and computer screens give oﬀ light that includes\\n‘blue light’ (although we don’t really notice the blue colour). Blue light aﬀects the brain, making it harder to\\nfall asleep. Try orange or red light bulbs for the bedside lamp.\\n \\nSecurity objects. Let your child sleep with a favourite blanket or stuﬀed toy to feel safe.\\n \\nPets. Your child or teen might feel better with the family dog or cat close by. Take care, though, sleeping\\nwith pets in the same bed can get in the way of a good night’s sleep.\\n \\nRespond quickly to comfort your child or teen when he wakes up from a nightmare. Let your child or teen\\nknow that she can come to your room if needed. Some parents ﬁnd it helps to let their child come in to their\\nbed when after a nightmare, until the child feels safer.\\n \\nCo-sleeping in the same room. Young children can feel safer and be comforted more easily with parents in\\nthe same room. Some families share a family bed. But this doesn’t work for everyone. Sharing a family bed\\ncan disrupt everyone’s sleep.\\n \\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) recommends that babies sleep in a crib with only a ﬁtted sheet\\nnext  to the adult’s bed for the ﬁrst 6 months. The Canadian Pediatric Society reminds parents that babies\\nunder 1 year are safest in their own crib. http://www.caringforkids.cps.ca/handouts/safe_sleep_for_babies\\n \\nAvoid or limit scary or violent books, stories, movies or games.\\n \\nDiscuss nightmares openly during the day. When your child or teen is calm, you may wish to ask about the\\nnightmares and the feelings they cause (for example, fear or lonliness).', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Nightmares in Children and Youth.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Then together, come up with a new ending that isn’t scary. Older children and youth can do\\nthe writing themselves, if they wish.\\n \\nFor older children and youth, help them prepare a wall poster they can look at when a nightmare wakes\\nthem. The poster can list and illustrate things they can do when they wake from a nightmare. For example:\\nWhen I have a nightmare, I can:\\nTurn on the light.\\nTell a parent or caregiver.\\nRemind myself that I am in a safe place.\\nPractice grounding strategies:\\nWhat are 5 things that I can see?

For example, if the child was dreaming about being chased by a\\ndragon, avoid a ‘new’ ending where the child kills the dragon. Instead, perhaps the dragon was\\nhungry, or lonely?

She buses to school, so breakfast is usually just a cup of\\ncoﬀee. Lunch is often just a muﬃn. Because she’s hungry, she often buys snacks from a vending machine. She\\nknows that she’s sleep deprived because she doesn’t feel rested when her alarm wakes her up in the morning.\\nJane has been feeling stressed, anxious and tired. She reluctantly sees her family doctor, who recommends that\\nJane start with some changes to her food intake.\\nIntroduction\\nThe bad news: Our modern, hectic lifestyle, being surrounded by unhealthy foods and other factors can make it\\nhard to eat healthy meals.\\nThe good news? There are ways to eat healthy using familiar foods that you can ﬁnd at your local grocery store.\\nHealthy eating includes: \\nEating a wide variety of foods to give your body the nutrition it needs (energy, proteins, carbohydrates, fats,\\nﬁbre, vitamins, minerals and water);\\nHaving three meals a day plus snacks in between if you’re hungry;\\nPreparing and sharing meals with friends and family;\\nEating in a mindful way. This means sitting down at a table, relaxing and eating slowly while enjoying the\\ntaste of the food. This helps us to feel our body’s hunger and fullness signals.\\nAdvantages of healthy foods: \\nCan save you money. Foods that contribute to good health (like whole grain breads and cereals, fruits and\\nvegetables) may require some preparation but can cost less than highly processed, pre-packaged and fast\\nfoods. \\nWill make your brain and body feel better.

The American Paediatric Society recommends (Trasande,\\n2018):\\nDo the following… \\nEat fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables when possible, and support that eﬀort by developing a list of low-\\ncost sources for fresh fruits and vegetables\\nUse alternatives to plastic, such as glass or stainless steel, when possible.\\nWash your hands before handling foods and/or drinks, and wash all fruits and vegetables that cannot be\\npeeled.\\nDo try to avoid the following… \\nAvoid processed meats, especially maternal consumption during pregnancy.\\nAvoid microwaving food or beverages (including infant formula and pumped human milk) in plastic, if\\npossible.\\nAvoid placing plastics in the dishwasher.\\nAvoid plastics with recycling codes 3 (phthalates), 6 (styrene), and 7 (bisphenols) unless plastics are labeled\\nas “biobased” or “greenware,” indicating that they are made from corn and do not contain bisphenols. To\\nﬁgure out the recycling code, you can look at the bottom of plastic products to ﬁnd it. \\n“I haven’t eaten regular meals in years! Where do I start?”\\nMake changes gradually.

And hence,\\neveryone has a role to play in helping make things better.\\nHow Common is it?\\nOver a six month period, about 1.6% of the population has OCD (Greist and Jeﬀerson, 1995, 1998).\\nWhen Does OCD Start?\\nOCD can start at any age. Because symptoms are often mild in the beginning, it is often not picked up until the\\nperson is older. According to the National Institute for Mental Health, most cases of OCD are diagnosed in early\\nadulthood, around age 19. About 1/3 of adults believe their OCD started back in their childhood or adolescence.\\nHow is OCD Treated?\\nThe good news is that there are various eﬀective treatments and ways to deal with OCD. The two main types of\\ntreatments that can help OCD are:\\n \\n1. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) : a type of therapy that helps a person with OCD learn new ways to think\\n(\"cognitive\") and ways to do things (\"behavioural\") to deal with the OCD. CBT is usually provided by a psychologist\\nor psychiatrist. There are many books on OCD as well, which makes it easier and easier for people with OCD and\\ntheir families to learn about these strategies and use them on their own (e.g., \" Talking Back to OCD \" by John\\nMarch).\\n \\n2. Medications : speciﬁc serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) help OCD by aﬀecting the function of the serotonin, a\\nbrain chemical. Medications can be very helpful in situations where a person has not responded to non-medication\\ntreatments.\\n \\nMedication may be needed for a shorter or longer period depending on the person\\'s need.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in Adults.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 3 / 5\\n \\nIn a very small percentage of cases, OCD is due to a type of bacterial infection known as streptococcus and in\\nthose cases antibiotics may be helpful.\\nCognitive Behaviour Strategies for OCD\\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is one of the most eﬀective treatments for obsessions or compulsions and\\nuses both cognitive and behavioural techniques (March, 1998).\\n \\n1. Cognitive Strategies\\n \\nOCD makes a person have OCD thoughts, and cognitive (thought) strategies are about replacing OCD thoughts\\nwith more helpful thoughts.\\n \\nFor example, a person with cleanliness obsessions touches something at work and gets the automatic thought\\n(cognition), \"Now I\\'m all dirty and I\\'m going to get sick! I have to wash my hands!\"\\n \\nCognitive techniques help the person develop more helpful coping thoughts such as, e.g. \"I\\'m not going to let the\\nOCD push me around! So what if I\\'ve just touched ___? I\\'m not going to get sick.\"\\n \\n2. Behavioural techniques\\n \\na) OCD Hierarchy\\n \\nA hierarchy is a way of deciding which OCD behaviours to work on ﬁrst. It involves ranking one\\'s compulsions (or\\nobsessions) from those that are easy to resist, to those that are \\'medium\\' diﬃculty to resist, to those that are\\nextremely hard to resist doing.\\n \\nb) Exposure with Response Prevention\\n \\nExposure is exposing yourself to the feared situation that triggers the OCD. For example, if your hand washing\\nrituals are triggered by touching \"contaminated\" objects, then you would gradually touch \"contaminated\" objects,\\nin a gradually increasing way.\\n \\nResponse prevention  is preventing the response (or ritual) that the OCD tries to boss you into doing.\\n \\nFor example, a person with hand washing compulsions would feel an urge to wash his/her hands after touching\\n\"contaminated\" objects. Response prevention is where the person agrees to stop doing the compulsion. Although\\nthis is anxiety-provoking in the beginning, the more this is done, the easier it becomes over time to stop doing the\\ncompulsion.\\n \\nThis is where the hierarchy comes in. The hierarchy is used to decide which situations to start working on ﬁrst.\\n \\nMaking a hierarchy is important because when starting to work on OCD compulsions with a therapist, it is usually\\nbest to start working on easy or moderately hard compulsions, as opposed to working with the hardest\\ncompulsions ﬁrst.\\n \\nFor example, a hierarchy of compulsions might look something like this:\\nEasiest: Touching my own things\\nEasier: Using the toilet at home\\nHarder: Touching friend\\'s possessions; Using toilet at friend\\'s home\\nHardest: Touching things at work; Using toilet at work\\nOCD is the Problem, Not You', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in Adults.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 4 / 5\\nRealize that OCD is the problem, not you. One of the most powerful strategies to deal with OCD is realizing\\nwhat is you, and what is OCD.  Using this strategy, a person with OCD might say something like this: \"Okay,\\nso I\\'ve just touched a doorknob. Now I feel this urge to go wash my hands. That\\'s the OCD again, trying to\\ntrick me. Its trying to make me think I\\'m contaminated. I\\'m not going to give in; I\\'m going to beat this thing\\nand not let it push me around.... Just like I planned it with my therapist, today\\'s plan is to wait at least 5\\nminutes until giving into the OCD... Who knows, maybe after 5 minutes that OCD urge will be gone...\"\\nIf you Suspect OCD\\nIf you suspect that you may have OCD, then start by seeing a medical doctor.  In extremely rare cases, OCD may\\nactually be caused by a type of infection known as streptococcal infection. In these cases, treatments such as\\nantibiotics may be helpful. The doctor may also recommend more specialized mental health services, or help with\\nreferrals to mental health professionals such as a psychologist, psychiatrist or social worker.\\nRecommended Readings\\nFor Adults\\nStop Obsessing!: How to Overcome Your Obsession... by Edna B.

       " Document(page_content='Page 4 / 7\\nFor example, a hierarchy of compulsions might look something like this:  \\nEasiest: Touching my own things\\nEasier: Using the toilet at home\\nHarder: Touching friend\\'s possessions; Using toilet at friend\\'s home\\nHardest: Touching things at school; Using toilet at school\\nNarrative Strategies for OCD\\nNarrative therapy (White, 1990) is a powerful way to deal with problems by talking about them in a certain way.\\nMany therapists will use both narrative and cognitive behavioural strategies in treating OCD in children and youth\\n(March, 1998).\\n \\nMake the OCD the problem, not the person with OCD.  Although  OCD symptoms can be very frustrating and\\ncause conﬂict with families, it is important to remember that it is not the child/youth that is the problem, it is the\\nOCD. A powerful technique from narrative therapy is to talk about the OCD in the third person, in order to help\\nparents join forces with the child, to work together against the OCD.\\n \\nA therapist might say something like:\\n \\nTherapist (or parent): You know this thing about needing to wash your hands over and over again? That\\'s not you -\\nthat\\'s a condition called OCD, and its tricking your brain into making you wash your hands.\\nWhat would it be like if OCD weren\\'t around anymore?\\nChild: A lot better.\\nTherapist (or parent): And that\\'s why we\\'re going to work together, and ﬁnd ways to keep OCD from bossing you\\naround.\\n \\nNaming the OCD. Although teenagers are usually happy to call the symptoms OCD, younger children often like to\\ngive it their own name.\\n \\nTherapist (or parent): Although we adults call it OCD, it can help if you give it your own name. Any name you want to\\ngive it?\\nChild: \"Germy!\" because it makes me think that I have germs all the time.\\n \\nOther examples of names that children/youth call OCD are: \"the brain bully\", Mr. Meany, Mr. Nag.\\n \\nAgree with the child on the goal, i.e. getting rid of the OCD. When faced with OCD symptoms such as hand\\nwashing, a natural response of many adults is to simply try to stop the child from hand washing. But since children\\nand youth may not have the same insight as adults, they may get upset if adults suddenly try stopping them from\\nengaging in the OCD rituals. From the child\\'s perspective, stopping the rituals is going to make them feel more\\ndistressed in the short-run. The challenge is for adults to help the child see that things would be better in the long-\\nrun.\\n \\nA therapist or parent might say something like this:\\n \\nTherapist: Okay, so what would it be like if we could help you get rid of Germy?\\nChild: A lot better!\\nTherapist: Remember what it was like before Germy started bossing you around?\\nChild Yeah... I didn\\'t have to wash my hands all the time. And I was able to go to my friend\\'s places.

It might be tough in the beginning, but eventually, you\\'ll feel better, and be able to do\\nmore fun things again, like going to hang out with your friends again. And your hands will feel so\\nmuch better.\\n \\nHere is another example of this:\\n \\nTherapist OCD tries to trick you into thinking your hands are dirty, so that you\\'ll have to wash them. What\\ndo you think?\"\\nChild Yeah... that\\'s what Germy does. I feel so icky and I just have to wash my hands.\\nTherapist And after you wash your hands, how do you feel?\\nChild Better!\\nTherapist What if we could ﬁnd another way to help you feel better, without having to wash your hands?\\nChild That\\'d be better!\\n \\nBlaming it on the OCD doesn\\'t take away responsibility. Some parents become worried that if we blame the\\nsymptoms on the OCD that the child might not take responsibility for dealing with the problem. For example, if a\\nchild with OCD gets into a ﬁght and hits his sister because she interrupted him during his rituals, he simply says,\\n\"Well, it\\'s not my fault, it\\'s the OCD!\"\\n \\nTo ensure that responsibility still stays with the child, a therapist (or parent) might say something like this:\\n\"You didn\\'t cause your OCD and it\\'s not your fault. It\\'s also not your parent\\'s fault or anyone else\\'s fault.\"\\n\"But it is still your responsibility for getting over the OCD. Like seeing a counsellor. [Or taking medications].\\nBut you\\'re not alone; we are all going to work together to help you deal with this. How\\'s that sound?\"\\nAsk your child how you can support him/her. You might say things such as:\\n\"How can we work together against the OCD?\"\\n\"Is there anything I can do to help you control the OCD, and keep it from controlling you?\"\\nPraise your child for bossing back the OCD. All children need praise, particularly children struggling with OCD.\\nA child struggling with OCD is often hearing a lot of criticism or negative comments from others.\\n \\nYou might start with:\\n\"How did you do today in bossing back the OCD?\"\\n\"I\\'m sure there were some times today where the OCD wasn\\'t as strong, or when you bossed it back. How\\ndid you manage to do that? What did you say or do that helped?\"\\nAnd of course, remember there are many ways to praise a child:\\n\"Good job on bossing back the OCD!\"\\n\"Awesome!\"   \\nSummary \\nOCD is a condition where a person experiences obsessions (distressing thoughts or images) and compulsions\\n(habits or rituals that s/he has to do over and over again).\\n \\nFortunately, there are many eﬀective treatments and strategies for dealing with OCD. \\n\"Tyrone is doing much better now...\"', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in Children and Youth_ Information for Parents and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

I think like most people, I was excited and\\nstressed at the same time. One day, after watching a TV show about germs, I became very worried about getting\\nsick. I became obsessed by the idea that I could get contaminated by these microscopic germs. Every time I met\\nsomeone, or touched a door knob or heard someone sneeze, I would worry.\\n \\nI started to worry about bringing these germs back home and harming my whole family. Soon, every time I tried to\\nleave the house, I would panic and need to go back to clean my hands and take a shower. I became stuck with fear\\nand always needed to “decontaminate” myself to feel better. I would take many long showers, change my clothes\\nseveral times every day and wash my hands until my skin was so dry, it bled. I felt judged going out with friends so\\nI made excuses to stay at home. My sister and I fought constantly because she couldn’t understand. The thought of\\nleaving home to go to school made me so worried I couldn’t sleep and led to many late night cleaning habits.\\nJust enough worries can be helpful\\nIts good to have just enough worries about certain things. For example, have just enough worries about cleanliness\\nmakes sure that you keep clean and wash your hands. Having just enough worries about checking things helps\\nmake sure that you don’t leave home and leave the doors unlocked, or leave a stove on. But when you have so\\nmany worries that the worries become a problem, then it may be OCD…\\nWhat is OCD?\\nOCD is a condition where you have problems with obsessions and/or compulsions.\\n \\nObsessions: Distressing thoughts or images that keep popping into your head uninvited, even if you try to ignore\\nthem.\\n \\nFor example, worries about:\\nGetting dirty or contaminated;\\nLosing control;\\nThings being perfect or symmetrical.\\nBad things happening to you, or to loved ones\\nYour sexuality', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)_ Youth Edition.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 6\\nCompulsions: Behaviours, actions or rituals that you feel forced to do, to make the obsessions go away.\\n \\nFor example, things like:\\nArranging things over and over again, in a certain way;\\nCounting things;\\nCollecting things\\nWashing and cleaning\\nChecking.\\nMost people living with OCD have both obsessions and compulsions. People living with\\nOCD often know their worries don’t make sense, yet still feel compelled to perform\\ncertain actions or rituals.\\nHow common is OCD?\\nYou are not alone! OCD is not uncommon; about 3% of people have OCD. So in a classroom of 30 people, there is\\nat least 1 person with OCD. Or in a school of 500 students, this means there are ~ 15 students with OCD.\\nWhen do people usually get OCD?\\nOCD usually appears between the ages of 10 and 12. It can also to show up during the late teens and early\\nadulthood.\\nWhat causes OCD?\\nMany things can contribute to OCD such as:\\nFamily History: OCD is more likely if you have family members living with OCD.\\nLife Events: OCD can be triggered by stress. For example, constantly showering and washing your hands\\nafter a media report about germs. Or it could be a stress that seems completely unrelated, like a breakup\\nwith a boyfriend/girlfriend, or conﬂict with your parents.\\nInfection: In some extremely rare cases, OCD may be triggered by a bacterial infection like Streptococcus\\n(or \"Strep\").\\nHow do I know if I need help?\\nYou should consider getting help if the worries are so severe that they are getting in the way of life at home,\\nschool, work, or your relationships. For example:\\nIf the OCD gets in the way of school/work: Distressing thoughts and compulsive rituals can make it hard to\\nfocus on classes and schoolwork. OCD can make it hard for some youth to go to school at all.\\nIf the OCD causes problems with low mood/energy: Distressing, obsessive thoughts and compulsions can be\\nexhausting, and also make it hard to get enough sleep. As a result, you may not have much energy and feel\\nquite irritable.\\nIf the OCD is causing stress in relationships: OCD can aﬀect relationships. Obsessive thoughts and rituals\\ncan sometimes leave little time for spending time with family and friends. Distressing thoughts and\\ncompulsive behaviours can also be a source of conﬂict with other family members.\\nHow do I get help?\\nIf you haven’t already started to get help, then the best way to start is to tell a trusted adult (e.g. your parents,\\nrelatives, older siblings, a teacher, guidance counselor, etc.)\\n \\nYou might say something like… “Can we talk sometime? There’s been something very stressful that I’ve been', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)_ Youth Edition.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 3 / 6\\ngoing through… I’ve been having these thoughts that don’t make any sense, and I’ve been having to wash my\\nhands over and over again… I was wondering if you might take me to the doctor…”\\n \\nYour parent(s) can then help you set up an appointment with your family doctor (or paediatrician), who can then\\nhelp you with the next steps, such as seeing a mental health professional with experience working with youth with\\nOCD.\\nTreatments for OCD:\\nThere are many treatments for OCD, which may include:\\n \\n1. Talk therapy (i.e. counseling)\\n \\nBy talking to a counselor/therapist, you can learn ways to cope and deal with OCD. One of these ways is Cognitive\\nBehaviour Therapy (CBT). CBT helps you explore how your thoughts impact your feelings and actions. It helps you\\nto see things from diﬀerent viewpoints of, and try to think about things in more helpful ways. You can also learn\\nnew skills and diﬀerent ways to handle your feelings.\\n \\nThere may also be other stresses in your life, at home or school. A counselor/therapist can help you deal with those\\nstresses as well.\\n \\n2. Medications\\n \\nIf the counseling/therapy is not enough, or if the OCD is severe enough, then there are anti-OCD medications that\\nmay be helpful as well. For example, SSRIs (serotonin reuptake inhibitors) help to balance serotonin levels in the\\nbrain. Some youth may need medications to help with anxiety while they’re working on new coping skills. Not all\\nyouth with OCD need medication. And when they do, they usually don’t need it forever.\\nSelf-Help for OCD\\n1. Support Network\\n \\nAre there people that you can just talk to about your OCD? Are these people able to listen and accept you just the\\nway you are, or are you feeling criticized and blamed?\\n \\nHaving a support network of close family and friends that you can turn to is important. People in your network can\\nsupport you diﬀerent ways, which includes:  \\nListening to what you are going through, without being judging or critical.\\nSpending time with you, going with you to doctor’s appointments, or in many other ways.\\nNot everyone is able to have a close network of supportive family members. If you do not feel that you can count\\non your family/friends, then speak to your counselor/therapist or doctor.\\n \\n2. Cognitive (thought) strategies\\n \\nWith practice you can learn to replace obsessive thoughts with more helpful ones. This is a really eﬀective way of\\nhandling OCD.\\n \\nFor example, when you touch something, a typical OCD thought would be “Oh no, I’m going to get sick”, which\\nleads to worry and fear, and leads to a strong urge to wash your hands.\\n \\nWith practice, one learns to replace OCD thoughts with more neutral or helpful thoughts, such as “I’m not going to\\nget sick, that’s just the OCD trying to boss me around”, which leads to feeling calmer, and less of an urge to wash\\nyour hands.\\n \\n3. Talking back to OCD\\n \\nPeople often describe OCD as that ‘little voice’ in their heads. It tells you lies and exaggerates while making you', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)_ Youth Edition.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 4 / 6\\nfeel bad about yourself. You may also be able to see that what you are doing is not rational. But you can’t resist\\nthe urge because that little voice is soooooo stubborn and persistent. It won’t stop unless you do your compulsive\\nbehaviour. The worst is, you already know the relief won’t last long.\\n \\nTake a moment and imagine what the OCD voice looks like. Is it a little bug or perhaps an unknown creature? Try\\nto imagine it as vividly as possible. What colours do you see? What are the textures? How does it smell? How does\\nit sound? You might want to give your OCD a name.\\n \\nOnce you have a mental picture of your OCD, it’s easier to see that the OCD is not you. But it is something that is\\ntrying to tell you what to do. So what are you going to do about it?\\n \\nWell, maybe it’s time for you to take back control...\\n \\nInstead of feeding into the obsessive thoughts or the urge for compulsive actions:\\nClose your eyes;\\nTake a few slow deep breaths;\\nThink about the mental picture of your OCD;\\nAcknowledge the OCD thoughts, e.g. “Hello OCD thoughts. See you later!”\\nPicture yourself being stronger and bigger than the OCD, e.g. “Thanks for the suggestion, but I’ll try\\nsomething else thank you.”\\nYour mind and imagination is powerful, and many people ﬁnd that using ‘visualization’, they can picture\\nthemselves getting back in control over the OCD. Obsessive thoughts are just thoughts; they don’t have to be the\\nboss of you.\\n \\n4. Exposure and Response Prevention (E/RP) Strategies\\n \\nThese are powerful strategies that can help you take back control from OCD.\\n \\nGuess what? Chances are that you’ve already used ERP without even thinking about it! Think of when you go\\nswimming, and you jump into the water. When you ﬁrst jump in, your body might be freaking out and your\\nthoughts might be saying things like “Holy cow this is cold…!” However, notice as you are hanging out in the pool,\\nyour body gets used to the cold and you gradually feel more comfortable. If you’ve ever gotten into water that felt\\ncold, but stayed in the water until you got used to it, then you have done exposure (i.e. jumping into the water)\\nand response prevention (i.e. staying in the water rather than just getting out).\\n \\nE/RP with Fear of Heights\\n \\nLet’s say you have a phobia of heights, to the point where you can’t climb up a ladder. Exposure would be climbing\\nup a ladder one step, and then coming back down again. The next time, you’d climb up the ladder two steps. The\\nnext time after that, three steps. As long as it is done gradually, and slowly enough, your body will get used to it,\\nand be able to climb up the ladder…\\n \\nExposure/Response Prevention with Fear of Being Dirty and Contaminated\\n \\nLet’s say you have a worry of being dirty and contaminated to the point where if you touched something (like a\\ndoorknob), you feel that you need to wash your hands.\\n \\nWorking with your therapist, you’d come up with a response prevention plan.\\n \\nOne possible exposure/response prevention plan would be:\\nI will touch a doorknob, and instead of immediately washing my hands like usual, I will wait 5-seconds1.\\nbefore washing my hands. While waiting, I will use the coping strategies that I’ve practiced with my\\ntherapist already like deep breathing, relaxation or distraction… \\nI will touch a doorknob, and I will wait 10-seconds before washing my hands. While waiting, I will use my2.\\ncoping strategies... If successful, then I will try the next step\\nI will touch a doorknob, and I will wait 20-seconds before washing my hands. While waiting, I will use my3.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)_ Youth Edition.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

If successful, then I will try the next step…\\nI will touch a doorknob, and I will wait 30-seconds before washing my hands, etc.4.\\nSo very slowly, step-by-step, using a plan that you and your therapist agreed with, you would gradually wait longer\\nand longer until washing your hands. The incredible thing is that at some point, after waiting enough, the urge to\\nwash your hands will become less and less, until it no longer gets in the way of your life…\\nMy story part 2...\\nMy OCD was ruining my life and also impacted my family. My parents were concerned for me and connected me\\nwith a therapist I really liked. She helped me understand that I had OCD and helped me improve my coping.\\nThrough CBT, I’ve learned other ways of looking at things. I’m able to challenge the urges that were trying to\\novercome my life. Now, I might still be a little bit of a germaphobe, but at least I’m able to go back to school and\\nhang out with my friends.

They are essential to health and\\nwellness. Studies show they may also be helpful in preventing and treating medical conditions\\nthat aﬀect the brain, heart and other organs.\\nFor healthy youth and adults, experts recommend eating ﬁsh (particularly fatty ﬁsh like salmon,\\nmackerel, lake trout and sardines) at least two times per week (AHA, 2017) or to take 250\\nmg/day of omega-3 fatty acids as a supplement (USDA, 2010; WHO, 2008).\\nFor youth and adults who suﬀer from depression or other mental health conditions, experts\\nrecommend taking 1,000-2,000 mg/day of EPA, one of the more common omega-3 fatty acids.\\n(Peet, 2005; Bozzatello, 2016; CANMAT, 2016; Sarris, 2016).\\nWhat are Omega-3 Fatty Acids?\\nOmega-3 fatty acids are fats found in the diet that are essential to the human body for:  \\nThe brain (and nervous system). \\nThe skin, joints and soft tissues. \\nThe heart. \\nThere are three diﬀerent types of omega-3 fatty acids:\\nEPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) - decreases inﬂammation in the body. It is important for general health. \\nDHA (docosahexaenoic acid) - helps our cells communicate with each other. It is an important omega-3 fatty\\nacid for the brain, eyes and heart. \\nALA (alpha-linolenic acid) - used by the body as energy. Taking DHA and/or EPA is usually recommended\\nover taking ALA.  \\nIn past centuries, omega-3 fatty acids were high in our diet. Many changes in modern society now make it diﬃcult\\nfor the average North American child or adult to consume enough omega 3-fatty acids to provide health beneﬁts\\n(Papanikolaou, 2014). This may be a factor in the increase we have seen in the past century in certain medical, like\\nheart disease and diabetes.\\nWhat are the Symptoms of Low Omega-3? \\nMost of the time, people who have a diet low in omega-3 will not have any signs or symptoms.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Omega 3 Fatty Acids and Mental Health.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Page 2 / 6\\n \\nNonetheless, symptoms that can be seen include:\\nPhysical symptoms: excessive thirst, frequent urination, rough or dry ‘bumpy’ skin, dry, dull or ‘lifeless’ hair,\\ndandruﬀ and soft or brittle nails. \\nAllergy symptoms: eczema, asthma, hay fever. \\nVisual symptoms: poor night vision, sensitivity to bright light or visual disturbances when reading.\\nAttention/concentration problems: distractibility, poor concentration or diﬃculties with memory.\\nMood problems: depression, mood swings or anxiety. \\nSleep problems: especially diﬃculty settling at night or waking in the morning.\\nIf you have any of the above, it is possible that this could be from a low diet in omega-3 fatty acids.

Omega-3 and\\nomega-6 fatty acids compete for space in the body.\\n \\nBecause omega-3 fatty acids reduce inﬂammation in the body and, at high doses, omega-6 fatty acids cause\\ninﬂammation, it is important to increase the quantity of omega-3 in the body than omega-6 fatty acids.\\n \\nUnfortunately, omega-6 fatty acids are much more common in the diet than omega-3 fatty acids.\\n \\nTo get the best out of taking omega-3 fatty acids, it is important to reduce the intake of omega-6 fatty acids in our\\ndiet (Husted, 2016).\\n \\nThe recommended ratio is 4:1 for omega-6 to omega-3 in our diet or better (lower omega-6 and higher omega-3).\\nHow Can I Change My Diet to Improve Health and Wellness?\\nIncrease Omega-3 \\nTake supplements recommended by a health care professional, like your doctor or pharmacist.\\nEat ﬁsh and seafood.  \\nDecrease Omega-6\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Omega 3 Fatty Acids and Mental Health.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

In CBT, individuals learn to replace negative or worry thoughts with\\nmore rational and helpful alternatives..\\nProlonged Exposure (PE): PE is a form of CBT that involves reviewing the traumatic event by recounting it in\\ndetail and working with the reminders (triggers) of the trauma rather than avoiding them. This treatment\\nmethod is very eﬀective for OSI’s and involves individual work with a clinician and homework each week.\\nCognitive Processing Therapy (CPT): CPT involves achieving a better understanding of the traumatic event,\\nprocessing traumatic experience and acquiring the skills needed for better coping. This treatment method is\\nalso CBT-based and may be done individually or within a group.\\nGroup therapy:  Group therapy involves meeting with a group of people who have also been through trauma\\nand have an OSI, with guidance from a group leader (such as a psychologist or social worker). Group\\ntherapy is powerful because you are meeting with others who understand what you've been through.\\nSharing with the group also can help you build self-conﬁdence and trust. Unlike some therapies which focus\\non the past, group work focuses on the present.\\nFamily therapy: Family therapy is a type of counseling that involves your whole family which is important\\nbecause OSI's can aﬀect the family, and family support is needed to help you cope with an OSI. A therapist\\nhelps you and your family to communicate, maintain good relationships, and cope with diﬃcult emotions. In\\nfamily therapy, each person can express his or her fears and concerns. By doing this, your family will be\\nbetter prepared to help you.\\nMedications: Various medications, such as antidepressants, may be helpful to reduce the symptoms of OSI,\\nsuch as depression, anxiety and insomnia, and these may be prescribed by a family physician or\\npsychiatrist.\\nHow Can I Help Myself If I Have an OSI?\\nKnow your limits and triggers.\\nEducate yourself\\nConﬁde in someone you trust\\nAccess resources in your community, your place of work\\nGetting Help for an OSI\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Operational Stress Injury (OSI).pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

They are not easy to grow -- they require special soil, and just the right\\namount of water and sunlight. When their needs are not met, they do not do well.  But why are orchids so loved?\\nBecause when their needs are met, they are capable of blooming spectacularly. \\n“Orchid” People \\nHuman beings are similar. Studies show that people can be grouped into three main groups, depending on how\\nsensitive their nervous systems are wired:   \\n \\n1. Dandelions (29%) are not very sensitive. \\n \\nDandelion people are pretty hardy and do reasonably well, without special care.\\n \\n2.

       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 3\\n3. Orchids (31%) are highly sensitive \\n \\nUnder stress, orchids are more sensitive. They may be more sensitive to physical stress such as noise, light and\\nother sensory input.  They may also be more sensitive to emotional stresses. As a result, it can be challenging to\\nlive with an orchid, because of their particular needs.\\n \\nOn the other hand, when conditions are right, orchids will bloom with their unique strengths. Their strengths might\\nbe kindness, caring and compassion. Or perhaps athletics, or the creative arts. \\n \\nSociety needs all sorts of people -- tulips, dandelions and orchids, as each has their strengths that they contribute\\nto society. \\n \\nOther terms used to describe people who are sensitive include ‘sensitive temperament’, the ‘highly sensitive\\nperson’, and ‘superfeelers’. \\nHow to Look After Your Orchid Child \\nAccept that you have an orchid child.\\n \\nAccept that the same strategies which may appear to work on non-orchids (e.g. positive and negative\\nreinforcement approaches) may work less well on orchids. \\n \\nProvide the extra care emotional care that your orchid needs:  \\nBe patient, and give them more of your time.  \\nBe empathetic and validating on how they feel, which may be more than with others. \\nDo stay calm with them as best as you can, as they can easily sense your upset. If you get upset, it\\nwill be more likely they will get upset. \\nProvide a calm, low-arousal environment for your child. “Highly sensitive people” are often\\n‘introverted’, and have less need for social activities. They may need more quiet, and after activities,\\nmay need more rest.\\nProvide consistent, regular routines. Inconsistency and unexpected changes without warning are\\ndiﬃcult for orchids. If there are changes, give them advance notice. \\nOrchids Can Bloom Spectacularly\\nIt is not easy to raise an orchid child (or live with an orchid person). But when we can ﬁgure out what they need,\\nthey are capable of blooming spectacularly.

It’s okay. Introduce the kids to your co-\\nworkers. Other parents are working from home with their new ‘co-workers’ (i.e. children) too.\\nLet your children know that by being responsible and independent, they can contribute to the wellbeing of\\nthe family by letting their parents work.\\nAre you having troubles staying focused?

Consider turning on the Screen\\nTime (iOS) or Digital Wellbeing (Android) features in your Settings to help you track your screen time. \\nAre you having to homeschool your kids, now that school is suspended?\\nEnsure that your children eat breakfast.\\nConsider having the more intense subjects and learning activities (e.g. math) as the ﬁrst subjects in the\\nmorning.\\nAfter a break, you can then do more creative activities (e.g. drawing, music) in the afternoon.\\nIntersperse academic periods with physical movement and/or time outside.\\nSome studies show after 20-minutes of intense focus, a break is required.\\nOptometrists recommended the 20-20-20 rule -- every 20-minutes, look at least 20-feet away, for at\\nleast 20-minutes.\\nOptometrists also recommend at least 1-hr outside daily, in order to get enough light that keeps\\nchildren’s eyes from becoming near sighted.\\nContact your child’s teachers. Ask what resources they have available for students throughout this time.\\nInquire whether teachers are hosting regular, daily group chats with their classes. In the least, your child’s\\nteacher(s) can hopefully email you appropriate learning assignments. And best case, many teachers are\\nhaving regular, daily group chats with their classes.\\nRemember that every moment is a teaching opportunity.

Think about each sense, and see if there is something that is soothing for each of them. For\\nexample:\\nVisual: Photos such as of family that are comforting. Materials to draw with or pictures to colour.\\nSmells: Scented candle or essential oils such as lavender or vanilla.\\nMovement: A rocking chair, or mini-trampoline to jump on. Turn on the music and dance around the\\nhouse.\\nRepetitive movements are soothing such as\\nFine motor: Knitting, coloring, painting, sculpting, scrapbooking, crafts, etc.\\nGross motor: Jumping rope, drumming (on a nice quiet drumming pad), rocking, etc.\\nDeep pressure: Cuddling in a heavy blanket or comforter, using an actual weighted blanket.\\nOral: Bubble gum, chewing on ice, etc.\\nHave quiet periods in the schedule: This allows everyone to have a break from each other, especially if you\\nhave children who are introverted.\\nTry to follow your children’s lead on self-regulation routines, but if they do not have the ability to self-\\nregulate, then provide your expertise as an adult. \\nSelf-compassion\\nBe easy on yourself during this unprecedented time.

Episodes can be so distressing that people end up being\\nhousebound in an attempt to avoid having an attack. The good news however, is that there are\\nmany eﬀective coping strategies and treatments to help with panic attacks.\\nPenny’s Story, Part 1\\nPenny has always been a bit of a worrier, but now she’s started having periods “out of the blue” where she feels\\nsuddenly anxious, along with shortness of breath, feeling sweaty. The periods are so severe, that it feels like she’s\\nhaving a heart attack. Worried that she might be having a heart attack, she goes to the Emergency Department at\\nher local hospital. Good news, she ﬁnds out it\\'s not a panic attack. But the bad news is that she keeps on having\\nthese attacks, and just doesn’t know what to do. What advice would you give Penny?\\nWhat are Panic Attacks?\\nPanic attacks are periods of intense fear and anxiety, caused by a sudden release of adrenaline in the body\\ncausing symptoms such as:\\n \\n1. Physical symptoms\\nHeart symptoms, e.g. heart racing or pounding, chest pain\\nBreathing symptoms, e.g. shortness of breath, feeling smothered\\nDigestive system symptoms, e.g. nausea, vomiting or stomach pains\\nInner ear (i.e. vestibular) symptoms such as feeling dizzy, lightheaded or faint\\n2. Emotional symptoms \\nIntense fear, anxiety or dread\\nDepersonalization, i.e. feeling that things aren\\'t quite real, or feeling detached from oneself\\nFear of losing control or going crazy, e.g. \"I\\'m worried I\\'m losing my mind\"\\nFear of dying\\nThe fears in a panic attack can be particularly bad. Until it is diagnosed, people often feel they are having a', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Panic Attacks in Adults.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 8\\nheart attack, going crazy or feeling like one is going to die.\\nAlthough the period of intense panic is relatively brief (lasting only a few minutes up to half an hour), there can be\\na persisting lower grade anxiety that can continue for hours afterwards.\\nWhy Do People Have Panic Attacks?\\nIt is normal to get anxious from time to time, as this helps protect humans against dangers. Throughout most of\\nhuman history, the biggest dangers that human beings have faced have been physical dangers. As a result, we\\ndeveloped an alarm system to help us face those physical dangers. When triggered by a potential physical danger\\n(e.g. a sabre tooth tiger attacking us), our alarm system jumps into action, and creates a surge of adrenaline in our\\nbrain. The adrenaline surge makes us breathe more quickly (to get more oxygen), and helps us either “ﬁght” the\\ndanger, or take “ﬂight” by running away from the danger.\\n \\nThe good news with modern society, most of us no longer worry about physical dangers in our day-to-day lives\\nsuch as being attacked by sabre tooth tigers.\\n \\nThe bad news however, is that modern society has others stresses and ‘dangers” such as\\nStresses and worries about our work, relationships and ﬁnances.\\nPhysical stresses such as too much caﬀeine; not getting enough sleep, being sedentary... \\nOur primitive hunter gatherer alarm system is not as well suited to modern stresses, and as a result, vulnerable\\nindividuals may ﬁnd that their alarm system becomes trigger to have ‘false alarms’ such as panic attacks.\\nTerms\\nPanic attacks are:\\nA sudden burst of anxiety with distressing feelings of anxiety and physical symptoms.\\nAs many as 40% of people have had panic attacks happen out of the blue at some point in their life, but\\nmost of them do not go onto develop panic disorder (avoidance of situations) or agoraphobia.\\nPanic disorder is:\\nRepeated panic attacks that leads to avoidance of situations, in an attempt to avoid having another panic\\nattack. .\\nAgoraphobia is:\\nA type of avoidance where individuals avoid public places or open spaces, in an attempt to avoid a panic\\nattack. Individuals can become housebound where they are unable to leave home, out of fear of having an\\nattack in public. The term agoraphobia is from the Greek words “agora-”, the marketplace, and “-phobia”, a\\nfear, meaning  ‘a fear of the marketplace’.\\nWhere to Find Help for Panic and Anxiety\\nIf you are having problems with panic and anxiety, then it might be helpful to:\\nSee your family doctor, who can 1) make sure that there aren’t any medical problems that are contributing\\nto your anxiety, such as thyroid problems, heart problems, or other conditions and then 2) recommend what\\ntypes of treatments (such as counselling) and supports may be helpful in your area.\\nSelf-Help for Anxiety and Panic Attacks: Between Attacks\\nHere are some strategies to try between panic attacks: ', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Panic Attacks in Adults.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Caﬀeine is a stimulant, and as a result, it can worsen anxiety.\\nLimit alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana and other drugs .

The good news is that there are many things that\\ncan help with panic attacks.\\nPetra's Story\\nPetra is in her last year of high school. Unfortunately, it has been a stressful year -- there have been diﬃculties\\nwith peers, and the work has been very hard as well. Now she’s having periods out of the blue where she feels\\npanicky and anxious for no reason. During these times, she feels her heart racing, starts sweating and has to leave\\nthe room, and ends up hiding in the bathroom until she feels better. Things are so bad that she is starting to skip\\nclasses in order to avoid having an attack…\\n \\n\\u2028How would you support Petra?\\nIntroduction\\nEveryone gets anxious from time to time. The good part of having ‘just enough anxiety’ is that it helps warn us\\nabout potential danger. But if there is so much anxiety (such as panic) that it starts to cause problems, then it may\\nbe an anxiety condition (such as panic attacks)...\\nWhat Are Panic Attacks?\\nPanic attacks are brief periods of intense fear triggered by a sudden release of adrenaline, which causes physical\\nsymptoms such as:\\nHeart (or cardiac) symptoms, e.g. heart racing, pounding heart, chest pain\\u2028\\nRespiratory symptoms, e.g. shortness of breath, feeling smothered\\u2028\\nGastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, e.g. nausea, vomiting or stomach pains\\u2028\\nInner ear (i.e. vestibular) symptoms such as feeling dizzy, lightheaded or faint\\u2028\\nAlthough the period of intense panic is relatively brief (lasting only a few minutes up to half an hour), one can\\ncontinue to feel anxious for hours afterwards. \", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Panic Attacks in Children Youth.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 7\\nWhy Do People Have Panic Attacks?\\nThe good news is that as human beings, we have an alarm system designed to warn us about danger. This is\\nuseful, because when faced with physical dangers (e.g. being attacked by a sabre tooth tiger), this alarm system\\njumps into action, and creates a surge of adrenaline in our body, which then helps us either “ﬁght” the danger, or\\ntake “ﬂight” and run away from the danger. Eventually, the danger passes, and then our body gets back to\\nnormal. \\n \\nUnfortunately, our alarm system is not as well adapted to deal with the more long-term stresses that we face in\\nmodern society, such as school, work, relationships, and the sensory overload of modern society. As a result, our\\nalarm system often becomes triggered, leading to panic attacks. \\nWhat Causes Panic Attacks? \\nSome people are more sensitive to having panic attacks, such as those with\\nA family history of anxiety or panic disorders: In these cases, it may be that their bodies are simply wired to\\nbe more sensitive. \\u2028\\nMore stressful childhoods to begin with, which makes the alarm system more sensitive. \\u2028\\nPanic attacks may be triggered by things such as: \\nPhysical stresses aﬀecting the body (e.g. certain drugs or medications such as too much caﬀeine; stimulant\\nmedications; thyroid problems.)\\u2028\\nEmotional or psychological/social stresses (e.g. problems with work/school, conﬂict with others)\\u2028\\nWhat Is the Diﬀerence Between Panic Attacks, Panic Disorder and\\nAgoraphobia?\\nPanic attacks: Sudden, brief period of intense fear with physical sensations. People can have panic attacks, but it is\\nnot called a disorder, unless it actually impairs one’s function or gets in the way of life.\\n \\nPanic disorder: When a person has had several panic attacks, which continue to occur, and in addition, where the\\npanic attacks cause problems with functioning with school, work or relationships. E.g. the person starts avoiding\\ngoing places, or avoids doing things due to fear of having a panic attack.\\n \\nAgoraphobia: When people avoid going out, generally due to fear of having a panic attack. Agoraphobia comes\\nfrom the Greek words “agora-”, the marketplace, and “-phobia”, a fear. Literally, it means ‘a fear of the\\nmarketplace’.\\nSelf-Help: What You Can Do BETWEEN Panic Attacks \\nWHere are some strategies that you can practice ahead of time to help yourself in the event you feel the anxiety\\ncoming on: \\nPractice deep breathing. When people are feeling anxious, they often tend to breathe faster.\\nUnfortunately, breathing too fast can actually make you feel dizzy and lightheaded, which then makes you\\nfeel even more anxious… \\u2028\\u2028\\nTry this:\\u2028\\u2028\\nTake a long, slow breath in through your nose. Imagine your lungs ﬁlling with air.\\u2028\\u2028\\nHold your breath, while counting “one, two, three”\\u2028\\u2028\\nExhale slowly through your pursed lips, while you relax the muscles in your face, jaw, shoulders, and\\nstomach. \\u2028\\u2028\\nRepeat\\u2028\\u2028', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Panic Attacks in Children Youth.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

A classic strategy that helps one breathe more slowly is breathing into a\\npaper (not plastic!) bag. \\u2028\\u2028\\u2028However, studies show that this is no more eﬀective than breathing into a hollow\\ntube. The key is to do something to slow down your breathing. \\nOther things that may be helpful to practice ahead of time:\\nButterﬂy hug.

Look for \\'butterﬂy hug\\'\\non Youtube.com to view videos on how to do this simple yet powerful technique.\\u2028\\n \\nDon’t avoid going places in order to avoid a panic attack . Because panic attacks are so distressing,\\npeople will sometimes avoid situations in a misguided attempt to avoid having more panic attacks.\\nUnfortunately, that just makes the panic harder to deal with the next time around, and leads to people\\navoiding more and more situations. For example, a student who has a panic attack in a classroom might\\navoid going back to that classroom, out of fear of having another panic attack. Unfortunately, this can lead\\nto people avoiding more and more situations. \\u2028\\u2028\\u2028 \\u2028\\n\\u2028\\nUse positive coping thoughts.\\u2028 Remind yourself that although the symptoms of panic are scary due to the\\nadrenaline rush, they are not dangerous nor harmful; it is not a heart attack and you will not die from having\\na panic attack.

One starts with simple goals, working up to harder\\nones. For example, if there is an urge to wash one’s hands, one starts by avoiding the urge to wash one’s\\nhands for 10 seconds before giving in. The next time, the time before washing is gradually increased to\\nlonger and longer times (e.g. 20 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) Eventually, it gets to the\\npoint where one is delaying the urge so long, that essentially the compulsive behaviour is overcome.\\n2) Medications \\nIs there any active strep infection?\\nIf so, one could treat with antibiotics (e.g. Azithromycin) for 7-10 days, as one would treat a usual infection. \\nAre there OCD symptoms? \\nIf so, then one can treat with speciﬁc serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as \\nFluoxetine (Prozac), \\nSertraline (Zoloft), \\nCitalopram (Celexa), \\nEscitalopram (Cipralex).\\nVarious other medications have been proposed, however there is still insuﬃcient evidence to ﬁrmly recommend\\nany other particular treatments.  \\nWhat Can Parents Do for PANS / PANDAS? \\nReach out for support and help for yourself. \\nIt can be very challenging caring for a child with PANS/PANDAS. \\nIf you are overwhelmed, then take a break and get support for yourself.

Physical activity, ideally outside, is\\nneeded for us to have a healthy body and brain. The problem with modern society however, is\\nthat it tends to promote sitting. We sit in cars to get places. We sit in front of screens for school,\\nwork and relaxation. It turns out that our sedentary lifestyle is contributing to the modern\\nepidemic mental and physical health problems. The good news is that there are many things we\\ncan do in order to get moving again. Start small and go slowly. It can be as simple as standing\\ninstead of sitting in your desk. Parking farther away from the store in the parking lot. Step-by-\\nstep, you’ll be moving in no time.\\nIntroduction\\nImagine you went to see your doctor, and your doctor prescribed you something that would help you feel happier,\\ncalmer, have more energy, and also prevent heart disease and dementia?\\nThe prescription is movement.\\nHumans Need to Move\\nThroughout most of human history, humans spent most of their time moving around outside. It is estimated that\\nour hunter-gatherer ancestors moved perhaps 10-15 kilometers a day. As a result, our brains and bodies require\\nphysical activity (and nature) in order to grow, develop and function at their best.\\nUnfortunately, in modern society, we tend to live a sedentary lifestyle, where we spend several hours a day\\ninactive (in front of a screen, sitting in a chair or couch, sitting in a vehicle). As a result, the lack of nature and\\nphysical activity may be contributing to many of the physical and mental health problems that we are seeing.\\nWhat is Physical Activity?\\nPhysical activity means anytime we move our bodies. It includes:\\nPhysical activity that we do as part of our day-to-day, such as walking to work; walking up and down the\\nstairs at work; biking to the store for groceries.\\nExercise: Activities we do on purpose for ﬁtness or training, such as going to the gym, or going for a run.\\nSport: Activities we do on our own such as running on your own, cycling, or team sports that we do with\\nothers', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Physical Activity and Mental Health_ Information for Adults.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 5\\nHow Does it Help?\\nLow-intensity movement on a day-to-day basis encourages our body to have neurotrophic or growth factors, which\\nbuilds brain cells in key brain areas such as the hippocampus, thus helping to improve moods.\\nHigh-intensity exercise releases the body’s feel-good chemicals known as endorphins, which lead to the “runner’s\\nhigh” that runners talk about.\\nThere are many physical and mental beneﬁts to being active, such as:\\nImproved physical health\\nHealthier cardiovascular system (thus less chance of heart disease, high blood pressure and\\ndiabetes)\\nHealthier overall ﬁtness (less chance of being overweight)\\nStronger bones (thus less chance of osteoporosis)\\nImproved brain health\\nBetter sleep\\nImproved focus and concentration.\\nImproved emotional health\\nBetter mood (which protects against depression and anxiety)\\nIncreased self-acceptance (and self-esteem) about your body\\nImproved social health\\nBeing active outside your home will give you more chances to meet other people. Simply walking\\naround the neighborhood and saying hello to others helps meet our need to be social.\\nWhich is Better, Indoor or Outdoor Activities?\\nStudies have compared the positive eﬀects of indoor physical activity (e.g. running on a treadmill) vs. outdoor\\n(“green”) activities (e.g. running outside), and show that outdoor or “green” exercise is the best. When people get\\noutside, they naturally move more than when they are inside.\\nBut what if the weather is bad outside? Remember there is no bad weather, just bad clothing. If you are worried it’s\\ntoo cold, make sure you get warmer clothing. If you are worried it’s too wet, get a nice waterproof rain jacket and\\nrain pants. Studies show that the people beneﬁt from being active outside, regardless of whether it’s a sunny day,\\nor rainy / cloudy day.\\nHow Much Exercise?\\nTry to get at least 30-minutes of physical activity a day.\\nIt doesn’t have to be all at once. It can be 30-minutes once a day, but it could be divided up, such as three 10-\\nminute walks.\\nWhat Counts as Exercise?\\nModerate exercise is recommended, such as going for a walk, which will increase your heart rate and breathing,\\nbut you can still talk comfortably.\\nPlus:\\nAdults should also do muscle and bone-strengthening exercises at least twice/week.\\nOlder adults (65+) with poor mobility should regularly do activities that help to improve balance and\\nprevent falls (e.g., yoga).\\nIt’s Hard to Exercise Because I Suﬀer from Depression\\nDo you have troubles with depression, anxiety or stress? If so, then this is even more reason to start moving.\\nStudies on depression show that doing at least 30-minutes a day for at least 3-5 days a week can signiﬁcantly help\\nwith mood and anxiety, with eﬀects seen in as early as 2 weeks after becoming more active.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Physical Activity and Mental Health_ Information for Adults.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

It can also be intimidating to see\\nthose health zealots that appear to exercise for hours every week, which can make the rest of us feel like giving\\nup. .\\nGetting started\\nStart low -- even a few minutes a day.\\nAccept that in the beginning, physical activity may not be that enjoyable.\\nIf the idea of a 30-minute walk every day is too much, then consider getting smaller bursts such as 10-\\nminutes bursts of activity. For example, instead of a 30-min. walk daily, one could have three ten minute\\nwalks.\\nBeginning of the Day\\nConsider a morning walk around the block before going to work, as many people feel more energetic at the\\nbeginning of the day.\\nCommuting to Work\\nActive transportation. Consider biking or walking to work. Even taking public transport is more active than\\ndriving. Or walking one bus or subway stop further before you get onto the bus or subway.\\nIf you drive to work, park farther away so you can get more of a walk.\\nAt Work / School\\nTake the stairs instead of the elevator.\\nWalk to talk to a colleague rather than just emailing.\\nTry walking meetings, where you and your colleague(s) talk while walking, as opposed to talking while\\nsitting.\\nHave a walk during lunch on your own or invite a co-worker.\\nIf you work at a desk, then stand rather than sit at the desk.\\nAfter Work / School\\nBike or walk for short trips in the neighborhood, rather than taking the car.\\nIf you do drive somewhere, park farther away in the parking lot.

With PTSD, the brain's alarm system is triggered by the trauma, leading to\\nsymptoms such as being hyper vigilant (i.e. constantly on alert).\\nDo I Have PTSD?\\nHave you been through traumatic events (such as violence, crime, combat or abuse) in the past?\\nIf so, then do any of the following apply to you:\\nAs a result of that event, do you avoid being reminded of this experience by staying away from certain1.\\nplaces, people or activities? Yes/No\\nDid you lose interest in activities that were once important or enjoyable? Yes/No2.\\nDid you begin to feel more isolated or distant from other people? Yes/No3.\\nDid you ﬁnd it hard to have love or aﬀection for other people? Yes/No4.\\nDid you begin to feel that there was no point in planning for the future? Yes/No5.\\nAfter this experience were you having more trouble than usual falling asleep or staying asleep? Yes/No6.\\nDid you become jumpy or get easily startled by ordinary noises or movements? Yes/No7.\\nDid you answer yes to four or more questions?\\nIf so, this indicates a high likelihood of having PTSD. Speak with a health professional.\\nIf not, then it indicates a lower likelihood of having PTSD. Nonetheless, if you are concerned, you should\\nalways speak with your health provider.\\nWhat is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)?\\nOur bodies have developed an alarm system that becomes triggered when there is danger. When a situation has\\nbeen stressful or traumatic  (e.g. violence, war, abuse, natural disasters), this triggers our alarm system. it is\\nnatural that one might be cautious or worried at reminders of those situations. Having just enough fear and anxiety\\nhelps people avoid these situations from happening in the future.\\nHowever, when the alarm system is unable to turn oﬀ, then the anxiety and fear becomes excessive, to the point\\nwhere it interferes with daily life. \\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a type of anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to stressful\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Trauma in Adults.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

In the right setting, sensitive, compassionate people are\\ngreat at helping others. On the other hand, too much sensitivity can make one more sensitive to developing\\nPTSD. \\nWhat types of events are traumatic and/or stressful? \\nSituations where one was exposed to actual danger, such as \\nBeing a victim of violence\\nWar or combat\\nBeing a ﬁrst responder such as a paramedic, police oﬃcer or ﬁreﬁghter\\nCar accidents and plane crashes\\nNatural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and ﬁres\\nViolent crimes, like a robbery or shooting.\\nThe death or serious illness of a loved one\\nDiﬃcult medical treatments.\\nWitnessing or being threatened danger (e.g. seeing others getting hurt, being bullied or intimated.)  \\nWhen trauma is severe, the following happens:\\nThe logical brain becomes overwhelmed, and is unable to process the experience of what has happened.\\nThe emotional brain may become overwhelmed, leading the person to become emotionally distressed, with\\nfeelings such as sadness, guilt, anxiety or anger.\\nThe primitive brain (which includes our body\\'s alarm system aka autonomic system and \"ﬁght-ﬂight\"\\nsystem) may become overwhelmed, leading the person to be in a state of\\n\"Fight\", i.e. feeling angry;\\n\"Flight\", i.e. feeling anxiety and avoidance;\\n\"Freeze\", i.e. being so overwhelmed, one does not know whether to take ﬁght or ﬂight (like a \"deer in\\nheadlights\").\\nShut down, i.e. zoning out, dissociating, spacing out, which is a way for the brain to protect itself from\\noverwhelming stress.\\nWhen Does PTSD Start?\\nSymptoms may start soon after a traumatic event and then continue. Other people develop new or more severe\\nsigns months or even years later. \\nWhen symptoms have lasted less than 4-weeks, they are oﬃcially referred to as \"acute stress disorder\". When\\nsymptoms have lasted more than 4-weeks, then the oﬃcial term is \"post-traumatic stress disorder\". \\nSymptoms of PTSD\\nClassic symptoms of PTSD in adults are: ', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Trauma in Adults.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

You may feel\\nthe same fear and horror you did when the event took place. You may have\\nnightmares. You even may feel like you\\'re going through the event again. This is\\ncalled a ﬂashback. Sometimes there is a trigger: a sound or sight that causes you\\nto relive the event. Triggers might include:\\n• Hearing ﬁrecrackers may trigger memories for a combat veteran;\\n• Reading about a car accident in the news may trigger ﬂashbacks for a crash\\nsurvivor;\\n• Hearing someone mention sexual assault may trigger memories for a woman\\nwho was sexually assaulted herself.\\n2. Avoiding any reminders of\\nthe eventYou may try to avoid situations or people that trigger thoughts or feelings of the\\ntraumatic event, or avoid talking or thinking about the event. For example:\\n• A person who survived a ﬂood may avoid watching television shows or movies in\\nwhich there are ﬂoods;\\n• A person who was robbed on the street may avoid going out in public;\\n• A person may simply avoid leaving home in order to try to stay safe, and end up\\nbeing housebound.\\n3. Feeling numb Through no fault of your own, your body may be \"numb\" and you may notice that\\nyou do not experience feelings as before. Examples:\\n• You may lose interest in people and activities that you used to enjoy;\\n• You may end up detaching from people in your life;\\n• You may forget about parts of the traumatic event or not be able to talk about\\nthem.\\n4.Feeling keyed up (also called\\nhyperarousal)You may be jittery, or always alert and on the lookout for danger. It can cause you\\nto:\\n• Suddenly become angry or irritable\\n• Have a hard time sleeping\\n• Have trouble concentrating\\n• Fear for your safety and always feel on guard\\n• Be very startled by other people.\\nAt What Age Does PTSD Start?\\nPTSD can happen at any age. When children have been through stressful situations, they can also develop\\nsymptoms of PTSD.\\nSymptoms in children can include:\\nPhysical problems\\nComplaining of stomach problems or headaches a lot\\nBehavioural and emotional symptoms\\nRegressing, i.e. behaving like they did when they were younger.

Counselling/therapy\\nCognitive-behavioural\\ntherapy (CBT):Helps you overcome PTSD by dealing with your cognitions (thoughts) and behaviours\\n(learning coping strategies).\\nIn cognitive (behavioural) therapy (CBT), your therapist helps you understand and\\nchange how you think about your trauma and its aftermath. Your goal is to understand\\nhow certain thoughts about your trauma cause you stress and make your symptoms\\nworse.\\nYou will learn to identify thoughts about the world and yourself that are making you feel\\nafraid or upset. With the help of your therapist, you will learn to replace these thoughts\\nwith more accurate and less distressing thoughts. You also learn ways to cope with\\nfeelings such as anger, guilt, and fear.\\nAfter a traumatic event, people often blame themselves and feel guilty for things that\\nthey could not have changed.\\n• For example, a soldier may feel guilty about decisions he or she had to make during\\nwar. Hindsight is 20/20; it is easy to think about what one should have done, after it has\\nalready happened. But knowing what you could have done does not mean that you are\\nwrong or to blame for what happened.\\n• Furthermore, feeling responsible for what happened, lets the person feel a sense of\\ncontrol over the situation. But the reality is that they were not in control; and it was not\\ntheir fault. Children who are abused often blame themselves for the abuse. Rationally,\\nthis makes no sense. But the blame may happen because by blaming oneself for the\\nabuse, it lets the child feel responsible and have some sense of control.\\nExposure Therapy In exposure therapy your goal is to have less fear about your memories. It is based on\\nthe idea that people learn to fear thoughts, feelings, and situations that remind them of\\na past traumatic event\\nBy talking about your trauma repeatedly with a therapist, you\\'ll learn to get control of\\nyour thoughts and feelings about the trauma. You\\'ll learn that you do not have to be\\nafraid of your memories. This may be hard at ﬁrst. It might seem strange to think about\\nstressful things on purpose. But you\\'ll feel less overwhelmed over time.\\nWith the help of your therapist, you can change how you react to the stressful\\nmemories. Talking in a place where you feel secure makes this easier.\\nYou may focus on memories that are less upsetting before talking about worse ones.\\nThis is called \"desensitization,\" and it allows you to deal with bad memories a little bit at\\na time. Your therapist also may ask you to remember a lot of bad memories at once. This\\nis called \"ﬂooding,\" and it helps you learn not to feel overwhelmed.\\nYou also may practice diﬀerent ways to relax when you\\'re having a stressful memory.\\nBreathing exercises are sometimes used for this.\\nEye movement\\ndesensitization and\\nreprocessing (EMDR):EMDR practitioners use eye movements (or other means of \\'dual attention stimulation\\'),\\ntraumatic movements are processed into non-distressing memories.\\nEye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a fairly new therapy for PTSD.\\nWhile talking about your memories, you\\'ll focus on distractions like eye movements,\\nhand taps, and sounds. For example, your therapist will move his or her hand near your\\nface, and you\\'ll follow this movement with your eyes.\\nResearch suggests that helps by reducing the distress from traumatic memories, but the\\nexact way it helps is still being researched.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Trauma in Adults.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

In group therapy, you talk with a group of people who also have been\\nthrough a trauma and who have PTSD. Sharing your story with others may help you feel\\nmore comfortable talking about your trauma. This can help you cope with your\\nsymptoms, memories, and other parts of your life.\\nGroup therapy helps you build relationships with others who understand what you've\\nbeen through. You learn to deal with emotions such as shame, guilt, anger, rage, and\\nfear. Sharing with the group also can help you build self-conﬁdence and trust. You'll\\nlearn to focus on your present life, rather than feeling overwhelmed by the past.\\nBrief psychodynamic\\npsychotherapyIn this type of therapy, you learn ways of dealing with emotional conﬂicts caused by your\\ntrauma. This therapy helps you understand how your past aﬀects the way you feel now.\\nYour therapist can help you:\\n• Identify what triggers your stressful memories and other symptoms.\\n• Find ways to cope with intense feelings about the past.\\n• Become more aware of your thoughts and feelings, so you can change your reactions\\nto them.\\n• Raise your self-esteem.\\nFamily therapy PTSD can impact your whole family. Your kids or your partner may not understand why\\nyou get angry sometimes, or why you're under so much stress. They may feel scared,\\nguilty, or even angry about your condition.\\nFamily therapy is a type of counseling that involves your whole family. A therapist helps\\nyou and your family communicate, maintain good relationships, and cope with tough\\nemotions. Your family can learn more about PTSD and how it is treated.\\nIn family therapy, each person can express his or her fears and concerns. It's important\\nto be honest about your feelings and to listen to others. You can talk about your PTSD\\nsymptoms and what triggers them. You also can discuss the important parts of your\\ntreatment and recovery. By doing this, your family will be better prepared to help you.\\nYou may consider having individual therapy for your PTSD symptoms and family therapy\\nto help you with your relationships.\\nAdvantages of psychotherapy are:\\nPeople learn valuable skills that can beneﬁt them even after the PTSD has improved.\\nDisadvantages of psychotherapy \\nPsychotherapy may be harder to access in certain areas.\\nPsychotherapy takes a mental eﬀort that may be overwhelming when someone has had PTSD. \\nWhat will we work on in therapy?\\nWhen you begin therapy, you and your therapist should decide together what goals you hope to reach in therapy.\\nNot every person with PTSD will have the same treatment goals. For instance, not all people with PTSD are focused\\non reducing their symptoms.\\nSome people want to learn the best way to live with their symptoms and how to cope with other problems\\nassociated with PTSD. Perhaps you want to feel less guilt and sadness? Perhaps you would like to work on\\nimproving your relationships at work, or communication issues with your friends and family.\\nYour therapist should help you decide which of these goals seems most important to you, and he or she should\\ndiscuss with you which goals might take a long time to achieve.\\n2. Medication\\nAre there troubles functioning despite trying counseling/therapy? Or is counseling/therapy not possible? If so, then\\nmedications may be helpful. Medications known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), also used for\\ndepression, may be helpful for PTSD. SSRIs include citalopram (Celexa), ﬂuoxetine (such as Prozac), paroxetine\\n(Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft). They work by raising the level of serotonin (a type of brain chemical) in the brain.\\nAdvantages of medication:\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Trauma in Adults.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 6 / 7\\nTaking a medication is less work than seeing a therapist and having to talk or do therapy, and can thus be\\nhelpful when trauma is too severe to talk about or see a therapist.\\nDisadvantages of medications\\nMedications can cause side eﬀects. However, note that side eﬀects often go away, or can be managed with\\nlowering the dosage of the medication, or changing the medication if necessary. \\nSelf-Help Strategies for PTSD\\nMake sure you are safe. First of all, make sure that you are no longer in danger, and that you are safe!\\nFor example, if your trauma is from abuse or violence in the home, then get help ﬁrst in getting to safety.\\nSpeak to your doctor or contact an emergency shelter.\\nEducate yourself about PTSD.  Because the symptoms of PTSD (nightmares, ﬂashbacks and feeling that\\nyou are re-living the trauma) are so distressing, people with PTSD often worry that they are going crazy.\\nRelax - you are not going crazy . The problem is rather that you have anxiety because of a traumatic\\nevent. Fortunately, there are coping skills (in addition to treatment) that can help cope with this anxiety.\\nTake good care of yourself.  When under stress, sometimes we neglect our sleep, proper nutrition or\\nexercise. So make sure that you are 1) getting enough sleep, 2) eating a healthy diet with at least three\\nhealthy meals a day, and 3) getting regular exercise.\\nWays to Relax Your Body (by Turning Down Your Body\\'s Alarm System)\\nDeep Breathing:  When people get anxious, their breathing tends to quicken, which further worsens the\\nsituation. Purposely slowly your breathing can be helpful. There are now many online videos and apps that\\nyou can quickly view to help you in the moment with deep breathing. \\nGrounding Techniques: Grounding is a way of bringing your body back to the present, particularly if you\\nare having ﬂashbacks and losing touch with the present. Grounding works by re-setting and focusing your\\nattention on the present.\\nExamples of a sensory grounding would be: \\nVisual: Look around you and describe what you see, e.g. \"I\\'m in the living room, and I see pictures of\\nmy family.\"\\nHearing: Listen around you and describe what you hear, e.g. \"I\\'m hearing birds outside.\"\\nTouch: Scan your body and describe what you feel, e.g. \"I\\'m sitting on the couch, I can feel it against\\nme. I can feel my hand on my face.\"\\nSmell: Take a deep breath through your nose, and describe what you smell, e.g. \"I can smell my\\ncoﬀee.\"\\nCalming Exercises. There are many ways to move your body that may be calming for your nervous system.\\nThese can be especially powerful because when we are overwhelmed, we may simply not be able to talk\\nabout our feelings, or even accept validation and empathy from others. \\nHere is a link to a website that has videos showing how to do various movements: https://www.r4r.support  \\nExamples include the Butterﬂy Hug https://www.r4r.support/ﬁnding-safety-and-connection\\nAdditional tips for grounding:\\nKeep Your Eyes Open : While grounding yourself, keep your eyes open so you can see and focus on the\\npresent. It also helps to talk out aloud about what you are seeing and doing.\\nPractise:  Don\\'t be disappointed if it doesn\\'t work the ﬁrst time you try it. Like any other skill or sport you\\nhave done, this is a skill that gets better over time. It works best if you have tried and practised it ahead of\\ntime while calm.\\nStay active in life.  People with PTSD often ﬁnd that they drop out of activities that they previously enjoyed\\ndoing, but this is not helpful. It may be diﬃcult, but get back into the normal routine of your life as much as\\npossible, which includes; work, friends, family, hobbies and sports. Even if you can\\'t get back 100% into all\\nthe things you used to do, then start with little steps.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Trauma in Adults.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

Unfortunately, these fears have a tendency to grow, and then people end up\\navoiding more and more things in life. The best way to ﬁght back is to gradually face those fears, step by\\nstep.\\nExamples:\\nA person who has a trauma from falling oﬀ a horse. The longer the person avoids horses and horseback-\\nriding, the harder it will be. The solution is to get back on a horse as soon as possible.\\nA person experiences a mugging in a shopping mall parking lot at nighttime.

Unfortunately, many children/youth end up being exposed to stressful, traumatic\\nsituations. Examples of traumatic experiences for children experiencing child abuse or neglect;\\nloss of a parent; parental separation or divorce; bullying, including from other family members;\\nexperiencing natural disasters or accidents. After a trauma, many children/youth will be able to\\ncope and overcome their trauma. However, others may struggle with coping with their trauma,\\nand may have symptoms such as ﬂashbacks, hypervigilance, and avoidance of reminders of\\ntheir trauma. Some may even develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The good news is\\nthat there are many things that can be done to support a child/youth who has experienced\\ntrauma.\\nIntroduction\\nAsk any parent what they want for their children, and most will say that they would like their children to grow up\\nsafe and happy.  Unfortunately, many children and youth end up experiencing stressful and traumatic events in\\ntheir life. \\nExamples of trauma include:\\n“Acute”, single incident trauma, such as being in a car accident; being physically assaulted; experiencing a\\nﬁre, ﬂood, earthquake or other natural disasters; experiencing war, as a soldier or a civilian. \\n“Chronic”, repeated trauma which happens over and over again, such as: child neglect, physical or sexual\\nabuse, domestic violence; bullying (from peers or siblings); having a chronic medical illness. \\nWhat Happens During a Traumatic Event? \\nIn order to survive, human beings are wired with an alarm system that becomes triggered when we encounter\\nstressful events. \\nLet’s say you encounter a sabre tooth tiger. \\nThis activates our body’s autonomic nervous system (ANS), also known as our body’s alarm system. This all\\nhappens at an unconscious level, automatically. It leads to a ‘ﬁght/ﬂight/freeze’ response, to either 1) ﬁght the\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Trauma in Children and Youth_ Information for Families and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Our\\nalarm system is well designed for typical dangers that hunter-gatherers would face, e..g being attacked by wild\\nanimals. \\nIn PTSD however, the person’s nervous system is overwhelmed from the trauma, or from repeated trauma, and\\ntheir alarm system becomes always on, and easily triggered. \\nWhat Helps Children/Youth Overcome Trauma? \\nMany children and youth are able to overcome their traumatic experiences. \\nProtective factors that help a person get over trauma include:\\nFeeling connected to loving parents and adults;   \\nBeing physically healthy.  \\nWhat Makes A Child/Youth Vulnerable? \\nOn the other hand, some children and youth have more diﬃculties coping with their trauma. \\nThey may have “vulnerability factors” such as:  \\nThey may have already faced excessive amounts of stresses or trauma in their life (e.g. bullying, stresses at\\nschool or home, mental or physical illness in family members; substance use issues in family members).\\nSigns and Symptoms\\nWhen the brain is overwhelmed by stress and trauma, it becomes unable to normally process memories and\\nfeelings, and there may be the following symptoms: \\nRe-living (aka ‘re-experiencing’) the\\ntraumatic event. Examples include:\\n•  Flashbacks, which is an experience of seeing, hearing and feeling that one is\\ngoing through the event all over again (more common in teens than young kids)\\n• Nightmares of what happened, which makes it very hard to sleep;\\n• Re-enact the trauma in their play or in their drawings; \\n• Intrusive memories of the trauma. . \\nThese symptoms can be triggered by things such as:\\n• Seeing or hearing things that remind the person of the trauma\\n    ⚬ E.g. a person who was assaulted sees a news report about someone else\\nbeing assaulted and the memories come back, or they see the person who\\nassaulted them on a bus\\n    ⚬ E.g. a person who was raped is triggered by a sexual education class \\nAvoiding situations and reminders of\\nthe traumatic eventThe traumatic event is so stressful, that the child tries to avoid situations or\\nreminders of the event such as:  \\n• Refusing to talk or think about the event\\n• Avoiding people, places or activities that remind the person of the event. This\\ncan be a real problem if it’s part of their everyday life, like school or the bus.\\n• Keeping busy and distracted in order to avoid having to think or talk about the\\nevent.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Trauma in Children and Youth_ Information for Families and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

With children and youth,\\ntrauma may cause them to feel that\\n1) “the world is not a safe place”, “I cannot trust the others”, and\\n2) “I’m no good”, “I’m incompetent.” “I can’t keep myself or other people safe”.\\nSelf-Help Strategies for Parents and Caregivers\\nDo’s\\nSelf-Care for Parents and Caregivers\\nEnsure that as a caregiver or parent, that you have your own support network that you can turn to, such as\\n1) family and friends, 2) parent and peer support organizations, and 3) your own health professional. \\nPhysical safety\\nKeep your child safe. Ensure that your child is no longer exposed to people or things that are triggers for\\nthem, to whatever extent is reasonable. \\u2028\\nKeep the physical environment a soothing, calming environment. After trauma, people’s senses may be\\nmore on alert, as it is a way to try to detect threats. Thus, reduce the amount of sensory overload by having\\nless input, or use soothing input: \\nVisual \\nTry to reduce visual clutter in the background.\\nWhen talking with your child, be mindful of your facial expressions -- try to have a calm, warm,\\nrelaxed facial expression. Be mindful they may be hypersensitive to interpreting your stressed\\nout face as being angry at them.  \\nSound: \\nAs a result, try to keep the background quiet, e.g. don’t have TV playing in the background. If\\nyou do have background music or sound, consider classical music, nature sounds.  \\nVolume and tone of voice: When talking with someone who has been through traumatic or\\nfrightening experiences, use a slow, calm tone of voice, and avoid talking loudly, as well as\\nscreaming or yelling. \\nFor more information about using sensory interventions to help calm someone . \\nHave regular routines', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Trauma in Children and Youth_ Information for Families and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Accept that they may have been triggered. If\\nyour child is unable to express the trigger, then focus on supporting your child to get calm, rather than\\ntrying to ﬁgure out the cause. You might gently say, “I notice you’re breathing faster, and your face is red.\\nHow about we sit down on the couch, and I’ll make you a tea and we can sit together with the dog.” When\\nyour child seems calm enough, you might gently ask about what the trigger might have been.   \\nEmpathy\\nDo see things from your child’s perspective, and how having gone through what s/he has gone through, and\\nhow this would make it hard to trust others and/or see that the world is a dangerous place.\\nDo provide unconditional love, validation and acceptance. Children feel emotionally safe when they feel that\\nthey are loved and accepted no matter how they are feeling, or how they are behaving. People feel less\\nsafe, if they feel that they are only loved conditionally, i.e. they are only loved or accepted as long as they\\nare a certain way.  \\nEmpathize with sadness, and promote crying. \\nAllow your child to feel sad and cry. When someone has had a trauma, there is always something that\\nhas been lost.\\nE.g. a child in a car accident loses a parent.\\nE.g. a child who is assaulted loses the concept that the world is a safe place. \\nAllow and encourage crying, as tears help the brain to process the trauma and the loss. \\nE.g. Parent: “You’re sad. Its okay, it is a sad situation. Let the tears out… It’s important to let\\nthem out… Here’s a kleenex…”\\nEmpathize with anxiety \\nAccept that your child may be feeling scared and anxious. \\nExample\\nChild: “I don’t want to (insert activity here)...

Try to focus not on the behaviour, but on what is underneath. When your child is\\ncalm enough to take your feedback, express your frustration or sadness in a calm way. \\nValidate your child’s feelings. “I know you were frustrated at your sister. It’s okay to feel frustrated. \\nProblem-solve: “When you get frustrated, you can let me know.” \\nTeach emotional intelligence: “How do you think your sister felt when you hit her?

Counseling / therapy \\nWhat types of treatments exist for trauma?\\nDepending on the therapist, there might be diﬀerent types of trauma treatment such as:  \\nTrauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): Looks at negative, unhelpful thoughts and replaces\\nthem with more helpful, positive thoughts. Behavioral strategies can be used at a child's own pace to help\\ndesensitize the child to the traumatic parts of what happened so he or she doesn't feel so afraid of them.\\nTherapy can be 1:1 (where a therapist meets individually with the child/youth), or it may be in a group\\nformat with 1-2 therapists with 5-10 children/youth.  \\nEMDR and related ‘sub-cortical’ treatments such as brainspotting and progressive counting): These are\\ntypes of therapies designed to help the brain cope with trauma without needing to talk about the trauma in\\nthe way that classic talking therapies require. \\nProfessionals (such as psychotherapists, psychologists, and social workers) will typically use a “sequenced”\\napproach with 3 phases: \\nPhase I (Early Phase) Involves getting to know and trust the therapist; \\nLearning about self-care, how to cope with symptoms, and learning about self-regulation. \\nPhase II (Middle Phase) Exploring the trauma in greater detail, in order to help the patient process, work through and\\nmake sense of what happened. \\nFor example, rather than believing that “it happened because I am a weak person”, the person\\nmight see that “it happened and it wasn’t my fault, and I can move on from this…”\\nPhase III (Late Phase) Working on strategies to help the patient get back into their life such as school, work, home\\nand relationships.\\nIt is usually recommended to start with counseling/therapy. However, sometimes people are so distressed, that\\ncounseling/therapy is not possible.  \\n2. Medications\\nHave non-medication strategies, such as counseling, have already been tried, but not been helpful? \\nIf so, medications might be helpful. Talk to a physician (such as a family physician, paediatrician or\\npsychiatrist) to ask about medications. \\nMedications are not meant to be used alone as the sole treatment. Rather, medications can help reduce a\\nperson’s distress and anxiety, to the point that then the person is able to beneﬁt from other treatments\\n(such as counseling/therapy). \\n3. Peer Support \\nInterested in working together with others going through the same thing? \\nIf so, then peer support can be very powerful. Peer supports may include support for parents/caregivers, as\\nwell as children/youth aﬀected by trauma.. \", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Trauma in Children and Youth_ Information for Families and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

Symptoms can be quite severe, like having major depression that occurs with\\nevery period.\\nP.’s Story\\nP. is a thirty-something-year-old woman who has always had problems with her periods. Over the past year or so,\\nthey’ve gotten worse. Every time she’s about to have her period, it feels like she is depressed. Her mood is low,\\nand along with crying spells, she has trouble sleeping and increased fatigue. She also feels bloated and her joints\\nare stiﬀ. P has noticed that these symptoms are usually gone within a few days of her period starting. The\\nsymptoms are so severe that she is unable to work on those days. She hasn’t told her doctor about this because\\nshe thinks it must just be PMS.\\nWhat is Normal?\\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS)\\nMany women feel diﬀerent just before their periods, with symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which\\nconsist of:\\nPhysical complaints such as problems with sleep, appetite, feeling bloated, breast tenderness, and\\naches/pains.\\nMood symptoms such as mood swings, crying spells, and irritability.\\nSymptoms that happen around the same time every month, coinciding with their period, and which go away\\nwhen the period starts.\\nAlthough symptoms of PMS can be challenging, they do regularly interfere with a person’s daily life.\\nAbout 75% of women who have periods may have symptoms of PMS.\\nHowever, when those symptoms are so severe that it causes problems in life, it may be something more severe,\\nknown as PMDD.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)_ Information for Patients and Families.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

In the week before\\nyour period, levels of estrogen and progesterone drop, which aﬀects neurotransmitters in the brain.\\nCertain things, such as too much salty foods, stimulants (such as caﬀeine) and alcohol, may make things worse.\\nPeople are at a higher risk of having PMDD if they have:\\nExperienced stress and trauma in their lives, such as neglect or abuse.\\nFamily history of PMDD or premenstrual syndrome.\\nIs it PMDD / PMS or Something Else?\\nThere are other conditions where one might see similar symptoms as with PMDD / PMS such as:\\nPhysical\\nPerimenopause, i.e. the time that starts several years before menopause; during this time, your\\novaries start making less estrogen.\\nChronic fatigue\\nThyroid disease\\nIrritable bowel disease\\nMood', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)_ Information for Patients and Families.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Males are twice as likely to have problematic video gaming than females.\\nAll ages are aﬀected. Problematic video gaming seems to aﬀect youth and adults similarly.\\nWhat Causes Problematic Video Gaming?\\nModern technologies such as video games are designed to be addictive, which in turn, provides revenue for the\\nvideo game manufacturer. With advances in technology, today’s video games are far more addictive than video\\ngames just a decade or two ago.\\nOur hunter gatherer brains love dopamine and adrenaline, but the problem is that actual hunting and gathering\\ntakes a lot of eﬀort. Not to mention being potentially dangerous.\\nModern technology has been designed to give our brains that dopamine and adrenaline that they crave, without\\nany eﬀort. Not to mention with much less risk.\\nAs a result, it is no wonder that everywhere we turn, we see people glued to their electronic screens. Once a\\nperson becomes used to ‘easy dopamine and adrenaline’, it becomes very diﬃcult to get people to put down their\\ndevices and do other activities (e.g. go outside, amuse themselves without electronics, help with chores, etc.)\\nMany Factors Contribute to Video Game Addiction\\nThrough no fault of their own, many people are at a higher risk of developing a video game addiction, such as\\nthose with:\\nAnxiety and depression, which tend to make people withdraw from the real world\\nAttention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which makes them attracted to excitement and dopamine.\\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD), which makes it hard to relate to others.\\nMale gender: Males appear to be at a higher risk, possibly due to the fact that many video games\\nspeciﬁcally have been created to target males in particular.\\nCommunity factors can include:\\nLack of safe places for children/youth to play outside;', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Problematic Video Gaming (including Gaming Disorder and Video Game Addiction)_ Information for Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

When you\\nexpress gratitude by thanking your child for behaving well it encourages him to keep doing the right thing in\\nthe future.\\nBefore introducing technology such as video games, social media, or devices such as a cellphone, consider a\\ntechnology / media contract – they are a good start to ensure everyone understands the limits, and it’s also\\na great opportunity for conversation about healthy use.

It’s helpful to know that this is normal, to have some strategies in advance, and to\\nplan how you can redirect, de-escalate, and plan to engage them in another activity.\\nYour child’s friends will likely have diﬀerent technology rules and limits.

Unfortunately, there is\\nlimited evidence on the eﬀectiveness of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, compared to other\\nstandard treatments such as psychotherapy. Talk with a trusted healthcare provider if you are\\nwondering about psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.\\nD’s Story\\nD. is a 50-year paramedic. After years of exposure to diﬃcult, traumatic situations, he developed PTSD. He has\\ntried various treatments, but none appear helpful. One of his colleagues suggests he try using magic mushrooms.\\nIntroduction\\nPsychedelics (also known as hallucinogens) are a class of psychoactive substances that produce changes in\\nsensory perception, sense of time, emotions and thinking.\\nTypical eﬀects include\\nEuphoria, and a sense of relaxation and wellbeing;\\nHallucinations such as seeing and hearing things that others cannot.\\nSome people experience these as pleasant and, as a result, will use psychedelics on a recreational basis. On the\\nother hand, others can have a ‘bad trip’ where they experience negative moods and scary, disturbing\\nhallucinations. This can lead to panic and dangerous, risky behaviours, such as running across a road or even\\nsuicide attempts.\\nThere are many diﬀerent kinds of psychedelics. Some occur naturally, in trees, vines, seeds, fungi and leaves,\\nwhereas others are made in a laboratory. \\nCommonly used psychedelics include:\\nAyahuasca\\nDMT\\nLSD\\nNBOMes', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Psychedelic Assisted Psychotherapy.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

The “war on drugs” in the 1980s and 90s\\nsimilarly harmed investigation into psychedelics.\\nIn recent years, however, there has been renewed interest in using psychedelics thanks to newer research.\\nWhat is Psychedelic-Assisted Psychotherapy (PAP)?\\nPsychedelic-assisted psychotherapy (PAP) is ingesting a psychedelic drug in a controlled, supervised environment\\nas part of therapy for conditions such as addictions, anxiety and PTSD -- it is NOT simply ingesting psychedelics\\nrecreationally.\\nResearch\\nResearch suggests that psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy may help conditions such as PTSD, anxiety,\\ndepression and chronic pain, even in cases where conventional medical treatments have been ineﬀective.\\nOne study examined patients with severe PTSD who were given MDMA (the club aka ecstasy) and psychotherapy\\n(Mitchell, 2021). After treatment, the study showed that 67% had remission of their PTSD. The study authors\\nconcluded that “...MDMA-assisted therapy represents a potential breakthrough treatment that merits expedited\\nclinical evaluation.”\\nHow Might Psychedelics Work?\\nOne theory on how psychedelics might work is that they improve neuroplasticity, the brain’s ability to change and\\nadapt.\\nWhen people are overwhelmed by stress, anxiety, trauma or depression, the brain becomes ‘stuck’ and unable to\\nprocess. Psychedelics possibly help people process their stress, anxiety or depression, allowing them to see things\\nin a new light and make sense of their struggles. With the support of a therapist, the person can integrate their\\nnew thoughts and perspectives into their life.\\nWhat is the Legal Status of Psychedelics in Canada?\\nPsilocybin and magic mushrooms are controlled substances in Canada, which means they are illegal to use.\\nHowever, it is possible to access treatment through approved clinics that have Health Canada approval for legal\\naccess to psilocybin or receive Health Canada exemptions in exceptional situations (e.g. using psilocybin for\\nchronic pain associated with cancer).\\nWhat Psychedelic Therapy Looks Like\\nPsychedelic therapy (aka psychedelic counseling) is a type of therapy that combines:\\nTalk therapy, and\\nPsychedelics, generally psilocybin (aka magic mushrooms).\\nFirst visit\\nDuring the ﬁrst visit, you meet with the therapist.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Psychedelic Assisted Psychotherapy.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

When people are struggling with stress, anxiety, trauma or depression, one can imagine that the brain\\ncannot change or adapt. Psychedelics disrupt the “stuckness” and allow the person to access other ways of\\nthinking. For example, it might enable a person struggling with trauma to process and see their trauma in a new\\nlight, and allow them to realize a new sense of purpose, hope, belonging and meanwhile.  With the support of a\\npsychotherapist, the person can integrate their new thoughts and perspectives into their life.\\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\\nQ. Are psychedelics addictive?\\nA.

       " Document(page_content=\"Page 2 / 5\\nMost psychosis is not schizophrenia. \\nAbout 3-5% of the population will experience some form of psychosis in their lifetime (World Health Organization). \\nA small proportion of people experiencing psychosis will go on to have longer term problems with psychosis and\\nmay acquire a diagnosis of schizophrenia. \\nAccording to Health Canada, about 0.1% of children and youth have schizophrenia. \\nIn the general population, it is generally accepted that 1% has the diagnosis of schizophrenia (Hafner, 1997).\\n \\nWhat age does it occur at ?\\nIn males, psychosis mostly occurs in men in their late teens and early 20s.\\nIn females, it occurs in the mid-20s to early 30s. \\nIt rarely occurs before puberty or after age 45 (National Institutes of Mental Health, 2007).\\nDo You Suspect Psychosis? Getting Help for a Loved One \\nDo you suspect psychosis in a loved one? \\nIf so, they should be seen as soon as possible by healthcare provider (such as a family physician, nurse\\npractitioner or paediatrician). If necessary, they can refer your child to more specialized mental health\\nservices. \\nIn some communities, there are ‘ﬁrst episode psychosis' clinics set up to speciﬁcally assist with these types\\nof diﬃculties.\\nIs your loved one so distressed to the point where there are safety concerns, or they are unable to function? \\nIf so, you can also take your child to a hospital emergency room for an assessment. \\nHow Is Psychosis Treated?\\nA lot of emphasis is placed on identifying the ﬁrst onset of symptoms because treatment can be much more\\neﬀective if it is given early. (Malla 2006). Psychosis is linked to chemical imbalances of neurotransmitters in the\\nbrain, especially dopamine. Various medications which address these chemical imbalances can be very eﬀective in\\ncontrolling the symptoms of psychosis. Such medications are known as ‘anti-psychotics' or ‘neuroleptics.'\\n \\nCommonly used neuroleptics include:\\nRisperidone (trade name Risperdal),\\nOlanzapine (trade name Zyprexa),\\nQuetiapine (trade name Seroquel),\\nHaloperidol (trade name Haldol)\\nChlorpromazine. \\nAfter the symptoms of psychosis are reduced enough by medications, then the person will be better able to beneﬁt\\nfrom other interventions such as counselling / therapy.\\nPrognosis\\nIf a person has an episode of psychosis, and is treated with antipsychotic medication, then it is normally\\nrecommended that they remain on antipsychotic medication for at least one year. \\nAfter one year, 70% of patients who remain in active treatment will be in remission (Malla et al 2002). \\nIf a patient has had good symptom control in the ﬁrst year of treatment and wishes to come oﬀ medication, then\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Psychosis in Children and Youth_ Information for Parents and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Help the person to eat properly (three nutritious meals a day with healthy snacks), get\\nenough sleep, and get regular physical exercise (anything active is good, including dancing to favourite music or\\nplaying \"air-guitar\".)\\nAvoid recreational drugs. Marijuana, hallucinogens (e.g. mushrooms), and stimulants can all worsen or\\ntrigger psychosis, and should be avoided as much as possible.  \\n \\nHelp your loved one get treatment. Help your loved one get to doctor\\'s appointments. If medications have\\nbeen prescribed, then support the person in taking their medications.\\n \\nEmotional support : caregivers might say something like \"I want you to know that I\\'m here for you. How can I\\nhelp you?\" \"Tell me what I can do to support you.\"\\n \\nDon\\'t invalidate the other person. Don\\'t laugh or tell the other person that s/he is stupid or crazy, as this will\\nmake the other person less interested in conﬁding with you. Don\\'t say \"its just in your head.\"\\n \\nGet support from people that your relative trusts. If there is a particular person that your relative trusts (and\\nif you trust that person as well!), enlist that person\\'s help.\\n \\nReduce stress. Psychosis is made worse if the person is under a lot of stress. Help the person identify what\\nstresses they are under, and come up with a plan to deal with each one of them.\\n \\nFigure out what helps. Assist the person to keep track of what helps, and what doesn\\'t help their symptoms.\\nKeeping a diary can help with this.\\n \\nKeep things calm and avoid over stimulation. Psychosis makes people sensitive to being overloaded. If there\\nis too much going on (e.g. if too many people are around), help the person with psychosis to take a break by\\nsuggesting a quiet walk or having nap...\\n \\nCare for the caregiver.  If you are looking after someone with psychosis, make sure that you have someone to\\ntalk to who understands your experience, and that you take a break too! If you get burnt out, then who will look\\nafter your loved one?\\nHelping Someone Who Has Delusions\\nValidate the other person, but without reinforcing any delusions. Caregivers might say something like\\n\"You\\'re telling me that you\\'re worried about the CIA spying and following you. How\\'s that feel?\" Then, after the\\nother person talks about how s/he is feeling, it is important to validate that feeling. \"I can completely see how you\\nmight feel scared. I\\'d feel scared too, if I felt that I was being followed.\" In this way, you can empathize with how\\nthe person is feeling, without necessarily needing to say that you agree with the delusion.\\n \\nHelp the other person challenge unhelpful thoughts. In a gentle way, caregivers could try to show the other', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Psychosis in Children and Youth_ Information for Parents and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 4 / 5\\nperson the evidence for and against the delusion, in an attempt to help the person see that there is no evidence\\nfor the delusion. Caregivers might say, \"I hear what you\\'re saying. Tell me - what have you noticed that leads you\\nto think that you\\'re being followed?\" \"Why would they follow you?\" \"Are there any other possibilities?\"  Ask for\\npermission before telling the other person that their thoughts might not be correct. \"I care about you - would you\\nbe okay if I gave you my thoughts?\"  \"Based on what you\\'ve told me, you have done nothing wrong, so there is no\\nreason for the police to be following you.\"\\n \\nHelp the other person replace unhelpful with more helpful thoughts. \"You told me you wanted to not feel\\nso scared all the time. Instead of thinking, ‘everyone is out to get me\\', are there other, more helpful thoughts that\\nwould make you feel safer?\"\\nCoping Strategies For Hallucinations\\nAvoid things that worsen hallucinations. Avoid chemicals such as stimulants (like caﬀeine), alcohol and street\\ndrugs (especially marijuana, hallucinogens and stimulants).\\n \\nKeep busy. Hallucinations often happen when people are bored. Keep busy by doing things that require attention\\nsuch as\\nListening to music\\nReading a book\\nTalking to someone.\\nTalking to yourself .  Many people say that talking aloud helps. Try humming or singing quietly to yourself.\\nRepeat a calming phrase, such as \"I am safe, I am okay.\" Try reading aloud. You can get something called a\\n\"whisper-phone\" if your talking disturbs others -- a whisper phone is a plumbing joint, where you speak into it and\\nyou  can hear the sound, but it doesn\\'t disturb others.\\n \\nUse aﬃrmations. Using aﬃrmations is essentially replacing any negative or criticizing voices with more positive\\nvoices.\\nSay to yourself \"I am a good person\" or something along those lines.\\nAsk people to write down good  things about you on a piece of paper so you can read it when the negative\\nvoices start.\\nTape record what people like about you and also what you feel are positive qualities that you have. Listen to\\nit.\\nYour Role in Your Loved One\\'s Recovery\\nRecordkeeping. Recovering from psychosis may be complicated - you can help by keeping a record of changes in\\nbehaviour, medication trials, important contact information etc.\\n \\nPart of the Treatment Team - Be prepared to interface with doctors and service providers .  A person\\nexperiencing psychosis may not be thinking clearly - you, as a caregiver, have a role to play by sharing important\\ninformation and speciﬁc concerns regarding the health of your relative. Even if issues of conﬁdentiality may\\nprevent a service provider from giving you information, it is still very useful for you to provide them with\\ninformation.\\n \\nImportance of Hope - Recovery is a process that is diﬀerent for each person.  Your relative may become\\nimpatient or discouraged.  Be supportive and positive.  Understand that small steps forward may be huge\\naccomplishments for the person with psychosis..\\nFurther Readings\\nUseful Websites\\nThe Oﬀord Centre has information about a variety of mental health conditions in parent-friendly language.\\nhttp://www.knowledge.oﬀordcentre.com/   ', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Psychosis in Children and Youth_ Information for Parents and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

Do you see things that others can't see?\\nDo you worry about others following you? Do you have troubles with your thoughts and feelings?\\nIf you so, you are not alone. Many other people have similar experiences, and the good news, is\\nthat there are ways to help...\\nMy Story, Part 1\\nIt all started in college. I began having a hard time with school work, and my part-time job. I just couldn’t focus on\\nanything, and it was like my thoughts were all jumbled. And then I began hearing this really negative voice -- it was\\nquiet at ﬁrst, then it got louder. I began to feel that everyone was watching me. \\n \\nThings got so bad, that I had to quit my job and I began skipping classes. I hid this from my parents, but my friends\\nstarted to worry. I just wanted to hide all day. When I watched TV, I thought the people on the shows were\\nspeaking directly to me. \\n \\nLuckily, I had a good friend who told my parents, and they took me to see the doctor… At ﬁrst I was upset that my\\nfriend told my parents, but looking back, I’m very happy she told them, because in the end, thanks to my friend\\nand my parents, I began getting the help that I needed… \\nWhat is Psychosis?\\nPsychosis is a treatable medical condition that can aﬀect your thoughts, feelings and behaviours. Having psychosis\\ncan feel very scary. Sometimes you don’t even know what’s real or what’s not.\\n \\nFor example:\\nYou might hear things that others cannot, such as voices.\\nYou may see things that others cannot, such as people following you, or shadows.\\nYou may have some thoughts that can be very scary, such as worrying that others are out to harm you, or\\nthat the government is spying on you.\\nAll of these things can be extremely scary and frightening.  The good news, is that many things can be done to\\nhelp you in order to help you feel safer.\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Psychosis_ Information for Youth Coping with Psychosis.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Psychosis usually starts in teens and young adults (i.e. between age 16-30).\\nWhat Does Psychosis Look Like?\\nPeople with psychosis may:\\nHear, see, feel, smell or taste things that others don’t;\\nHave an unusual belief about something that other people don’t understand;\\nFeel suspicious or paranoid that others are watching or following;\\nHave troubles focusing, thinking or speaking;\\nWithdraw or isolate themselves from others;\\nLack energy or motivation;\\nFeel numb and not have much emotion;\\nHave trouble sleeping;\\nHave trouble doing everyday things like going to school, working, shopping or chores;\\nHave trouble with self-care, e.g. troubles bathing or showering regularly.\\nMany times when you have psychosis, you don’t notice anything wrong, and its more the people around you that\\nbecome concerned.\\nWhy Do I Have Psychosis?\\nIts complicated. There are many things that can increase a person's risk of getting psychosis such as:  \\nStress from home, school and relationships\\nTrauma, which is having gone through extremely stressful situations at home   \\nStreet drugs especially marijuana (i.e. weed / pot), stimulants (i.e. caﬀeine, cocaine) and hallucinogens\\n(such as shrooms, acid and LSD) \\nFamily history: If there are other family members who have had psychosis, then you may be at higher risk\\nas well. \\nHow is Psychosis Treated?\\nWith psychosis, the sooner that you get treatment, the better. Early treatment increases the chance that psychotic\\nepisodes will resolve. On the other hand, the longer that people wait, the harder it is to get treated and feel better. \\n \\nTypical treatments include:\\nMedications: Especially If you are feeling unsafe, hearing scary voices, or seeing scary things, medications\\ncan be very helpful.\\nKey points about medications:\\nThey are not addictive.\\nThey do not take control away from you, in fact they give you more control over your life, because\\nthey give you freedom from the distressing symptoms of psychosis.\\nImagine what it would be like to be free again fromhearing scary voices, seeing scary things, or\\nhaving scary thoughts!\\nOnce your symptoms are under control, then the medications can be stopped at a later date working with your\\ndoctor.\\nTalk Therapy (counselling).

A therapist can also educate your family about how to support you through this experience.\\nSelf-Help for Psychosis: Lifestyle Changes\\nThe good news is that these are many ways you can help your brain to deal with psychosis: \\nGet enough sleep, at least 8-11 hrs/night. Studies show that only 25% of teens get the sleep they\\nneed. The biggest reason? Staying up late from using electronic devices… Put your device away by 9 PM, so\\nthat you can be in bed by 9-10 PM, and hopefully get a good 8 to 11 hours of sleep…\\n \\nStay away from drugs and alcoho l. Many substances that can make hallucinations and paranoia worse\\nsuch as:\\nMarijuana, i.e. pot/weed. \\nHallucinogens such as LSD, shrooms \\nStimulants such as cocaine \\nLegal stimulants such as energy drinks / coﬀee.\\n \\nGet outside every day. Nature is good for the brain, and helps for many brain conditions including\\npsychosis. Ideally aim for 30-60 minutes outside every day. You might try:\\nWalking, biking, running outside.\\nSimply sitting outside when you read, or even use your technology. \\n \\nAvoid sensory overload . You may ﬁnd that you are very sensitive to noise, lights and other sensory\\nstimulation.\\nAre you bothered by too much noise? If so, you could try:\\n   * Letting others know that noise bothers you;\\n   * Finding a quiet place to go to, like your bedroom;\\n   * Wearing ear plugs.\\n   * Wearing headphones and listening to soothing nature sounds or relaxing music\\n \\nAre you triggered by too much light or ﬂuorescent lights? You could try:\\n   * Closing your drapes so its dimmer at home;\\n   * Wearing a baseball cap, hoodie or sunglasses if overhead light bothers you.\\nGet things done . It gets very stressful if you are falling behind in school, work or other obligations. Get\\norganized and stay and top of things. You can\\nTry to keep a regular schedule, e.g. have the same routine every day as much as possible.\\nPlan ahead, e.g. at the end of each day, think about what you have to do for the next day.\\nUse an agenda or calendar: When you have deadlines and things coming up, add new tasks into your\\nagenda (paper-based, cell phone or online). \\nMake To Do Lists: For stuﬀ that doesn’t ﬁt into a calendar, write it down on a To Do List -- there are\\nmany apps that can help with this. \\n \\nDeal with school stress.  Are you stressed out from school? If so, tell your school (i.e. your teachers or\\nguidance counselor) that you are feeling stressed out, so that they can work with you to ﬁgure out how to\\nreduce those stresses.\\n \\nDeal with home stress . Are you feeling stressed from home? Talk to your parents about your home\\nstresses to see if there is a solution. Unable to tell your parents? If so, then tell another adult that you trust,\\ne.g. relatives, friends of the family, teacher, doctor, or others. They might have some ideas on how to help. \\n \\nHave healthy activities in your routine. Too many people ﬁll their day with activities (e.g. sitting several\\nhours a day in front of a screen) which really isn’t healthy. Try to make sure you have healthy things in your\\ndaily routine, such as quiet time to chill out (without using electronics), yoga, sports or art…\\n ', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Psychosis_ Information for Youth Coping with Psychosis.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Place one hand on your chest, and the other on your belly.\\nClose your eyes if you’re in a place where you can do this\\nBreathe in deeply through the nose.\\nExpand your belly out as you breathe in. Notice how the hand on your belly moves out as you inhale.\\nNotice how the hand on your chest stays in the same spot.\\nHold your breath for a brief moment and release slowly through your nose (if your nose is clear).\\nFocus on the feeling in your belly or your nostrils as you breathe.\\nRepeat a few times.\\n \\nSpend quality time with others.

This includes people with anxiety, trauma and neurodevelopmental\\nconditions (such as ASD). SSP is based on polyvagal theory and was developed by Dr. Stephen\\nPorges.\\nAny of the Following?\\nDo you (or your loved one) have any of the following:\\nInstead of ﬁnding social interaction calming, ﬁnding that hearing other people and background noise can be\\ntriggering and stressful?\\nInstead of feeling calm and safe, ﬁnding that they tend to feel unsafe and on alert?\\nInstead of wanting to connect with other people, ﬁnding instead that they prefer being away from other\\npeople?\\nIf so, then read on to learn more about the Safe and Sound Protocol (SSP).\\nIntroduction \\nWe use our senses to perceive the world around us. Sound is essential. Our ears allow us to hear sounds, and\\nour brain makes sense of what we hear by perceiving and processing diﬀerent frequencies.\\nTo learn, work and play, our nervous system needs to be in a calm state emotionally and physically. To connect\\nwith people, we need to have a calm ‘social engagement system’.\\nHowever, some people have sensitive nervous systems that become easily distressed from the sounds involved in\\ntypical social interactions such as\\nHaving to interact with people at home;\\nBeing in a classroom with peers. \\nThese situations can be particularly stressful if there is background noise. ', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Safe and Sound Protocol (SSP).pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 4\\nWhen triggered by sounds, the brain enters a defensive mode where:\\nThe brain focuses on frequencies of threat and danger such as lower frequencies, e.g. think a low growl or a\\nlow male voice.\\nConversely, the brain is less focused on frequencies of friendly communication, e.g. high pitched sounds.\\nIt is a vicious cycle -- as a person listens for more threats, they will perceive more threats, and it continues\\nthe cycle. In the ear, the middle ear muscles and neural network fall into learned disuse, and the stapedius\\nmuscle becomes lax which makes it easier to hear lower frequency sounds. \\nThe problem, however, is that some nervous systems become easily distressed from the sound of social\\ninteraction, e.g. talking with others; being in a classroom with peers; having to interact with siblings or\\nparents at home. \\nWhen your nervous system is under stress (or distress):\\nThe body’s alarm becomes activated in order to defend itself from the danger, and can lead to ‘ﬁght’\\n(angry, irritability, aggression), or ‘ﬂight’ (anxiety), or ‘freeze’ (so overwhelmed that the system\\nfreezes) or “shut down’ (zoned out numb, dissociated.)\\nYour nervous system is not calm, which makes it diﬃcult to learn, work and play, i.e. you are not in\\n‘social engagement mode’.\\nPeople may have tried other treatments such as talking therapies. However, when one’s nervous system becomes\\ntriggered by the very sound of other people, talking therapies don’t work as well.\\nWhat is the Safe and Sound Protocol (SSP)? \\nDeveloped by Dr. Stephen Porges, the Safe and Sound Protocol (SSP) involves listening to specially engineered\\nsound that helps calm the nervous system and helps the person feel more safe, making it easier for them to\\nconnect with other people.\\nThe Safe and Sound Protocol (SSP) involves listening to 5 hours of specially ﬁltered songs.\\nThere is an adult playlist (songs by The Beatlers, U2, Nora Jones, Etta James etc.) as well as a child playlist (songs\\nfrom Disney movies such as Frozen, The Lion King, Toy Story etc.).\\nListening is done at the listener’s pace, as tolerated by their nervous system, anywhere from just a few minutes at\\na time up to one hour maximum per listening session.\\nThis is repeated as tolerated, and as prescribed by a clinician trained in administering the Protocol.\\nWhile listening to the Protocol, listeners may do many things, provided they are non-electronic, do not involve\\nspeaking with others, and do not activate the nervous system’s stress response (such as a frustrating puzzle).\\nActivities should be relaxing.\\nAcceptable activities include: Playing with Lego, doing a simple puzzle, playing with playdough, drawing, going for\\na walk, etc).\\nNon-acceptable activities include: Talking to someone else, reading, doing complex tasks, using a smartphone,\\ncellphone or computer.\\nThe original protocol involved listening for 60-minutes / daily for 5-days, but it turns out that this was very diﬃcult\\nfor many people, and clinically less eﬀective, hence the current protocol.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Safe and Sound Protocol (SSP).pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 3 / 4\\nFeatures of the engineered sound and auditory intervention in SSP includes the following:\\nLow frequencies are removed, as they are a primal trigger for danger. Examples include the low frequency\\ngrowl of a predator, an earthquake, and even the sound of males. In the ear, low frequencies lead the\\neardrum to loosen, which makes the ear more sensitive to low frequencies, which leads them to hear more\\nlow frequencies, which becomes a vicious cycle.\\nMore high frequencies are used, as they tend to be calming and soothing. Examples include the high\\nfrequency way that mothers instinctually talk to soothe their baby, so-called baby talk or ‘motherese’. In the\\near, high frequencies cause the stapedius muscle in the ear to tighten, which makes it easier to hear higher\\nfrequencies, leading to a positive cycle.\\nOver the course of the SSP protocol, diﬀerent frequencies are used, and the volume is decreased and\\nincreased, in order to train and exercise the ear (stapedius muscle) and the brain (via the vagus nerve) in\\norder to be less triggered by sound, and to feel safer. This occurs by allowing the ear to more easily ﬁlter\\nout lower frequency background sounds, and focus on higher frequency sounds, as as the human voice.\\nBeneﬁts of SSP\\nPeople feel safer, as their ﬁght/ﬂight response is less engaged. People are more able to socially engage with\\nothers. They can more listen and understand and talk with others, including the emotional meaning of language.\\n Over time, the person is better able to learn, engage and self-regulate.\\nWho Might Beneﬁt from SSP? \\nThere are various situations where people appear to have sympathetic nervous systems easily triggered by human\\nfrequencies where appears to be helpful: \\nAutism spectrum disorders (ASD) \\nSensory processing disorders (SPD) \\nAttention/deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD/ADD)\\nTrauma and PTSD\\nSocial engagement problems, i.e. problems connecting with other people socially\\nReading comprehension problems\\nSound sensitivity following brain injury (e.g. concussion) \\nGastrointestinal (GI) disruption due to nervous system overstimulation (e.g. reduction in binge eating\\nbehaviours, reduction in stress or anxiety-related diarrhea).\\nAutism spectrum disorders (ASD).\\nWhat Ages Can Beneﬁt? \\nIn general, people from age 2 and up. \\nHow Long Do Beneﬁts Last For? \\nIn general, peak results are seen at weeks 5-6.\\nIn many cases, eﬀects appear to ‘wear oﬀ’ after 2-months. When this happens, it is recommended to repeat\\nthe therapy at 3-month intervals, so-called “booster sessions”. Many therapists report that clients need 3-4\\ncourses of therapy. \\nCaution with SSP \\nAre there any of the following situations? \\nSeizure in the past year?

It can make you hear or see things that others\\ncannot see. It can make you have beliefs that others do not believe, such as feeling that others\\nare out to harm you. It can be extremely stressful, because these symptoms can cause troubles\\nwith relationships, with work and school. The good news is that there is help and treatment that\\ncan help get things better again.\\nIntroduction\\nSchizophrenia is a serious brain disorder that causes changes in a person\\'s thoughts, perceptions, emotions and\\nbehaviours. It can make someone hear or see things that others cannot see. It can make someone feel unsafe,\\nafraid, and lead to avoiding other people, and loss of function. Without proper treatment, it can cause serious\\nproblems with school, work and relationships. Fortunately, help is available for those with schizophrenia. In\\naddition, there are many things that family and friends can do to support their loved ones with schizophrenia.\\nDo I Have Schizophrenia?\\nThe following is a list of some symptoms of schizophrenia. If you (or a loved one) have these symptoms, speak with\\na doctor.\\n \\nDo you ...\\nHear voices that others can\\'t hear?\\nSee things that others can\\'t see?\\nHave extreme diﬃculties thinking clearly? Find that your thoughts appear jumbled?\\nWhat are the Symptoms of Schizophrenia?\\nThere are three main types of symptoms in schizophrenia:\\n \\n1. Active (or \"positive symptoms\"): unusual thoughts or perceptions, including hallucinations, delusions,\\nthought disorder.\\n \\nHallucinations: Hearing voices is the most common type of hallucination in schizophrenia. Some people hear one', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Schizophrenia.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 6\\nvoice, others hear many. These voices sound like a voice inside the person\\'s head. The voice may make comments\\nabout the person, or be critical and say mean things. Or the voice may order the person around and tell them to do\\nthings. Other types of hallucinations include seeing people or objects that are not there.\\n \\nDelusions: Delusions are strong personal beliefs that not commonly accepted by others. Types of delusions\\ninclude:\\nDelusions of reference: You feel that others are talking about you. For example, when you turn on the\\ntelevision, or read the newspaper, you feel that its about you.\\nDelusions of persecution: You feel that others are out to harm you. Wherever you go, you may feel that\\npeople are spying on you, following you, and planning to harm you in some way.\\n2. Passive (or \"Negative symptoms\") symptoms  are a loss of skills or abilities, such as having a loss or\\ndecrease in the ability to initiate plans, speak, express emotion, or ﬁnd pleasure in everyday life. These symptoms\\nare harder to recognize as part of the disorder and can be mistaken for laziness or depression. You may notice that\\nits hard to think clearly.\\n \\n3. Cognitive symptoms  (or cognitive deﬁcits) are problems with focusing, remembering, making decisions and\\nsolving problems.\\nHow Common Is It?\\nSchizophrenia aﬀects about 1% of the population.\\nWhat Causes Schizophrenia?\\nThere is no one single cause for schizophrenia, however there are diﬀerent factors which can increase a person\\'s\\nrisk of getting schizophrenia:\\nFamily history: Being related to other family members with schizophrenia can increase a person\\'s risk of\\ngetting schizophrenia.\\nDrug use: Using certain types of drugs, such as marijuana, or alcohol can increase a risk of psychosis. In\\npeople at high risk (e.g. such as those with family members with schizophrenia or psychosis), it is safest to\\navoid stimulants (such as cocaine, amphetamines), marijuana or PCP (\"angel dust\").\\nStress: Having signiﬁcant stress from school, work, home or relationships can increase one\\'s risk. \\nHow is Schizophrenia Treated?\\nAlthough there is no cure for schizophrenia, there are many treatments that can help signiﬁcantly such as: \\nMedications, and\\nPsychosocial interventions such as counselling/therapy.\\nTreatment: Medications\\nMedications that treat psychosis (antipsychotic medications) are eﬀective in reducing symptoms such as\\nhallucinations and delusions.\\n \\nThe original antipsychotic medications include chlorpromazine (Thorazine®), haloperidol (Haldol®), perphenazine\\n(Etrafon®, Trilafon®), and ﬂuphenzine (Prolixin®). The older medications can cause movement side eﬀects, such\\nas rigidity, persistent muscle spasms, tremors, and restlessness.\\n \\nIn the 1990s, new drugs, called atypical antipsychotics, were developed that rarely produced these side eﬀects.\\nExamples include: risperidone (Risperdal®), olanzapine (Zyprexa®), quietiapine (Seroquel®), sertindole\\n(Serdolect®), and ziprasidone (Geodon®).\\n \\nEveryone responds diﬀerently to antipsychotic medication. Sometimes several diﬀerent drugs must be tried before', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Schizophrenia.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Page 3 / 6\\nthe right one is found. \\n \\nWhen on a new medication, agitation and hallucinations usually improve within days and delusions usually improve\\nwithin a few weeks. Many people see substantial improvement in both types of symptoms by the sixth week of\\ntreatment. No one can tell beforehand exactly how a medication will aﬀect a particular individual, and sometimes\\nseveral medications must be tried before the right one is found.\\n \\nIf side eﬀects occur, you can try waiting until they go away. When people ﬁrst start to take atypical antipsychotics,\\nthey may become drowsy; experience dizziness when they change positions; have blurred vision; or develop a\\nrapid heartbeat, menstrual problems, a sensitivity to the sun, or skin rashes. Many of these symptoms will go away\\nafter the ﬁrst days of treatment, but people who are taking atypical antipsychotics should not drive until they\\nadjust to their new medication.\\n \\nHow Long Do I Need to take medications?\\n \\nLike diabetes or asthma, schizophrenia is a lifelong condition that needs constant attention. Although it cannot be\\ncured, treatment can signiﬁcantly improve the quality of your life. Most people with schizophrenia need to take\\nsome type of medication for the rest of their lives as well as receive other help, such as counselling/therapy.\\n \\nDon't Stop Your Medication Without Speaking to Your Doctor\\n \\nWhen you have schizophrenia, it is important to take your medication regularly, because by doing so, you will have\\nless symptoms of psychosis.\\n \\nRelapses (return of symptoms of psychosis) occur most often when people with schizophrenia stop taking their\\nmedication.\\n \\nIf you want to stop taking your medication, then speak with your doctor. Your doctor can help ﬁnd other options. \\n \\nCommon Reasons that People Stop Taking Medications\\n \\nReasons Why You Might Feel Like Stopping Your Medication     \\nI'm feeling better and I don't need the medication. If you're feeling better, that's great because it means the\\nmedication is doing its job.\\nIts hard to remember to take my medication. Ask the pharmacist at the drug store about ways to make it\\neasier to take your medication. Common ways include:\\nYou can get a special medication pillbox that has diﬀerent days of the week\\nYou can take your medications with meals\\nYou can set reminders on your alarm or watch\\nI don't like the way the medication makes me feel; I think I may be having side eﬀects. The good news is\\nthat often side eﬀects go away on their own over time. But if you are having side eﬀects that are troubling\\nyou, its better to let your doctor (or pharmacist) know about it, rather than just stop your medication.\\nTreatment: Non-Medication and Psychosocial Treatments\\nIn addition to medications, many other things are important:\\nLearning about how to manage schizophrenia. It helps signiﬁcantly when the person with\\nschizophrenia, as well as family and close friends learn about how to support the person with schizophrenia.\\nKey things include:\\nBasic facts about schizophrenia\\nBeing aware of early warning signs of relapse, and knowing what to do if there are signs of relapse \\nCoping skills to deal with persistent symptoms\\n \\nGetting help for any substance abuse . Many people with schizophrenia end up with problems with\\ndrugs or alcohol Getting help for these problems is very important.\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Schizophrenia.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Because schizophrenia often strikes at the critical years of 18-35, it may\\nstop people from being able to ﬁnish their education or ﬁnd a job. Special programs geared for those with\\nschizophrenia can help with ﬁnding work.\\n \\nFamily Education.  Patients with schizophrenia are often discharged from the hospital into the care of their\\nfamilies, so it is important that family members know as much as possible about schizophrenia. \\n \\nCounselling and therapy . Mental health professionals (such as psychiatrists, psychologists, social\\nworkers, nurses or occupational therapists) can provide talk therapy. \\n \\nSelf-Help Groups. Self-help groups for those with schizophrenia and families can provide a unique support\\nthat professionals cannot. Self-help groups are composed of  people dealing with the same issues, and are a\\npowerful way of getting mutual support from one another. It helps to know that you are not the only way\\ndealing with an issue, and its helpful to be able to beneﬁt from the knowledge of others going through the\\nsame thing. In addition, self-help groups in the long run can advocate and help change the system to better\\nserve those with schizophrenia.\\nSelf-Help for Schizophrenia\\nThere are many things that friends, family and caregivers can do to help:\\nEmotional support : Give emotional support to your loved one. Tell things such as \"I want you to know that\\nI\\'m here for you. How can I help you?\" \"Tell me what I can do to support you.\" When your loved one feels\\nsafe to turn to you, it makes it much more easier for you to make suggestions or advice for your loved one.\\n \\nHelping your loved one get treatment. If your loved one is not even wanting to get help, you may need\\nto speak with doctors or others in order to learn how to ﬁnd help. \\n \\nHelping your loved one follow through with treatment.  Even if your loved one has professional help,\\nit can still be hard to follow through with treatment. You can help by oﬀering to accompany or take your\\nloved one to doctor\\'s appointments. If medications have been prescribed, then support the person in taking\\ntheir medications. On the other hand, if you do not feel the medications are helpful, you can tell their doctor\\nas well.\\n \\nValidate feelings even if you can\\'t validate delusions. How should you respond when\\nsomeone with schizophrenia makes statements that are strange or clearly false?\\nBecause these bizarre beliefs or hallucinations are real to the patient, it will not be useful to say they\\nare wrong or imaginary. Going along with the delusions if you do not believe it will not be helpful,\\neither. What you can do is you can validate how the delusions make your loved one feel, and\\nsupport them with that. For example, if your loved one is feeling scared from feeling that they are\\nbeing followed by the CIA, then you can validate how scary that must be, and oﬀer your support.\\nYou may have to set limits as well on what you can and cannot do.\\nYou can calmly say that you see things diﬀerently than the patient does but that you acknowledge\\nthat everyone has the right to see things in his or her own way.\\n \\nDon\\'t invalidate your loved one.  Even if your loved one expresses viewpoints that you completely\\ndisagree with (e.g. delusions), don\\'t laugh or tell the other person that s/he is \\'stupid\\' or \\'crazy\\', nor say \\'Its\\nall in your head\\', as this will make the other person less interested in conﬁding with you. You can validate\\nthat for them, their experience feels real, and it is upsetting.\\n \\nGet support from people that your relative trusts.  If there is a particular person that your relative\\ntrusts (and if you trust that person as well!), enlist that person\\'s help.\\n ', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Schizophrenia.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

Help the person identify what\\nstresses they are under, and come up with a plan to deal with each one of them.\\nEnsure healthy lifestyle.  Help your loved one with lifestyle interventions such as: \\nEating properly (e.g. three nutritious meals a day with healthy snacks)\\nGetting enough sleep\\nGet enough time outside with physical activity \\nAvoiding street drugs or stimulants, or other drugs.\\n \\nKeep things calm and avoid over stimulation.  Psychosis makes people sensitive to being overloaded. If\\nthere is too much going on (e.g. if too many people are around), help the person with psychosis to take a\\nbreak by suggesting a quiet walk or having nap...\\n \\nHave a schedule. People with schizophrenia do best when they have structure in their lives, i.e. having a\\nroutine or schedule. Get a daily planner, scheduler or calendar. Write down in your schedule what daily\\nactivities you have, and at what times. Some people like to have a schedule made up well in advance. Other\\npeople may prefer a schedule made up a week before, or even just the day before.\\n \\nSupport systems are vital. Especially when a person has schizophrenia, it is essential to have a good\\nsupport network, which may include professionals, friends and family. Are there any other people that\\nshould be part of your loved one's support network? Contact them to get them involved.\\nCare for the caregiver.  If you are looking after someone with psychosis, make sure that you have\\nsomeone to talk to who understands your experience, and that you take a break too! If you get burnt out,\\nthen who will look after your loved one?\\nIn Case of Crisis: Tips for Families \\nWhen they are unwell, people with schizophrenia may resist treatment, believing that their delusions or\\nhallucinations are real and psychiatric help is not required.\\n \\nIf it gets to the point that a crisis occurs, family and friends may need to take action to keep their loved one safe.\\n \\nAlthough the exact laws may vary depending on where one lives, if a person is dangerous and unable to care for\\noneself due to mental illness, family/friends can contact a doctor (or police) to ask how to take a person to the\\nhospital.\\n \\nIn the emergency room, a mental health professional will assess the patient and determine the best course of\\naction. It may involve an admission to hospital, or other options.\\n \\nA person who does not want treatment may hide strange behavior or ideas from a professional; therefore, family\\nmembers and friends can ask to speak privately with the person conducting the patient's examination and explain\\nwhat has been happening at home. The professional will then be able to question the patient and hear the patient's\\ndistorted thinking for themselves. Professionals must personally witness bizarre behavior and hear delusional\\nthoughts before they can legally recommend commitment, and family and friends can give them the information\\nthey need to do so.\\nAfter the Crisis\\nCaregiving. Ensuring that people with schizophrenia continue to get treatment and take their medication after they\\nleave the hospital is also important. If patients stop taking their medication or stop going for follow-up\\nappointments, their psychotic symptoms will return. If these symptoms become severe, they may become unable\\nto care for their own basic needs for food, clothing, and shelter; they may neglect personal hygiene; and they may\\nend up on the street or in jail, where they rarely receive the kind of help they need.\\n \", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Schizophrenia.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

Each\\nstep toward these goals should be small enough to be attainable, and the patient should pursue them in an\\natmosphere of support. People with a mental illness who are pressured and criticized usually regress and their\\nsymptoms worsen. Telling them what they are doing right is the best way to help them move forward.\\nSummary\\nSchizophrenia is a serious brain disorder that causes changes in a person's thoughts, perceptions, emotions and\\nbehaviours.

I\\'d get sad and start crying for no reason. I\\'d just hibernate - stop going out,\\nsleep all the time, and couldn\\'t stop eating carbs, and I\\'d gain ten pounds every winter. And then I realized that\\nreally what I had was winter depression.\"\\n \\nSeasonal aﬀective disorder (aka SAD, season depression or winter depression in North America) is a type of\\ndepression that occurs in the fall/winter months. It usually begins in late fall or early winter and goes away by\\nsummer, and is felt to be due to the seasonal lack of sunlight.\\n \\nBut doesn\\'t everyone get a little bit down in the winter?\\nA lot of people do get the \"winter blues\", where they may feel a bit more down or sad in the winter. But with\\n\"winter blues\", the symptoms don\\'t get in the way of life like they do in winter depression. \\nWhat Does Seasonal Depression look like?\\nThe classic symptoms of seasonal depression are:\\nMood problems such as sadness, boredom or feeling more irritable\\nIncreased need for sleep\\nFatigue and low energy\\nIncreased appetite, with cravings for carbohydrates (such as bread, pasta, sweets), which may result in\\nweight gain\\nA tendency to want to avoid social situations, as well as being more sensitive to rejection\\nLoss of interest or pleasure in activities\\nWith more severe symptoms, one may also note feelings of hopelessness or helplessness. \\n \\nSymptoms come back every fall and winter months (when there is less sunlight).\\n \\nSometimes it can be hard to ﬁgure out whether or not the mood problems are due to lack of sunlight or due to', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Seasonal Depression (aka Winter Depression).pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

The doctor may\\nrecommend more specialized mental health services such as seeing a psychologist, psychiatrist or social worker.\\nHow is Seasonal Aﬀective Depression (SAD) Treated?\\nLight Therapy\\n \\nBecause seasonal depression is a result of less sunlight, the treatment of choice is to provide that missing light via\\nlight therapy. \\nWhat is it? Sit in front of a special lamp (with UV ﬁlter) that can deliver a suﬃciently bright light to treat\\ndepression (i.e. 5,000 to 10,000 lux of light; lux is a measure of light). You don't stare directly into the light,\\nbut rather you sit near it and do other activities such as reading, working on the computer, eating breakfast,\\netc.\\nWhen? Usually in the morning. \\nHow long? Sit near a lightbox for 30-60 minutes a day, most often in the mornings.\\nUntil when? Light therapy is done during the fall/winter months, until enough daylight is available, typically\\nin the springtime.\\nSigniﬁcant improvement can often be seen within days.\\n \\nSide eﬀects of light therapy\\n \\nWhen used properly, light therapy seems to have very few side eﬀects. Side eﬀects include eye strain, headache,\\nfatigue, irritability and trouble sleeping at night (if light therapy is used too late in the day).\\n \\nCaution is required with light therapy in people with bipolar or manic depressive disorders (due to possible risk of\\ncausing a manic episode); skin that is sensitive to light, or medical conditions that make their eyes vulnerable to\\nlight damage.\\n \\nTanning beds are not helpful for treating seasonal depression, as they provide a diﬀerent type of light (i.e. UV light)\\nthat is more for tanning than for helping depression.  \\nSelf-Help and Coping with Seasonal Depression \\nLifestyle strategies \\nGet enough sleep. \\nEat a healthy diet. \\nTake advantage of natural daylight in the winter as much as possible.\\nExercise daily outdoors by going for walks during daylight hours, or other activities, and get someone to go\\nwith you.

The\\ntruth is that life isn't easy, and we all encounter disappointment, loss or suﬀering at times. Life\\nis a road with potholes. The problem is that we may respond to bumps in the road with a\\nnegative inner voice that criticizes or lays blame. That just makes things even worse.\\nThe good news is that there is a solution. When faced with disappointment, loss or suﬀering, we\\ncan treat ourselves with loving kindness and self-compassion. We can give ourselves emotional\\nsupport, just as we would a close friend or family member who’s suﬀering. Self-compassion is\\nnot about telling ourselves that we’re better than others in some way. It’s about accepting\\nreality: no matter how special we’d like to think we are, we’re human just like everyone else.\\nAnd part of being human is that we’ll all face failure, disappointment and loss at some point.\\nBy accepting that we’re imperfect, we can change our inner voice to one that’s supportive, self-\\naccepting and self-compassionate. As a result, our brains will make fewer stress chemicals so\\nthat we can feel and cope better.\\nSamantha’s Story, Part 1 \\nSamantha usually has a good day at work. She’s normally on time, she has a reasonable boss, and her co-workers\\nare pretty easy-going. But recently, she had a very bad day. She was late for work. Her boss was upset. And she\\nhad a disagreement with a co-worker.\\n \\nAs a result, a negative, self-critical voice started running in her head: “I'm such a disappointment. Nobody likes\\nme! Why do I even bother? No matter what I do, it’s going to fail.”\\n \\nSamantha had a rough childhood. She didn’t feel accepted by her parents, and at school, there was a bully who\\ntormented her for years. \\n \\nSamantha wants to believe that deep down she’s a good person. But it’s so hard to change that negative voice.\\nDo I Have Self-Compassion?\\nWhen you face disappointment, loss or suﬀering, what type of inner voice do you tend to have?\\n \\na) A negative, self-critical voice that: \", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Self-Compassion.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

The good news is that you can change the negative voice that brings you down into a more\\npositive inner voice that brings you up.\\nWhat Is Self-Compassion?\\n“It is not your job to like me. It’s mine.”\\n— Toni Bernard \\n \\nSelf-compassion is being kind and compassionate to yourself during times when you feel that you’re inadequate, a\\nfailure or suﬀering (Neﬀ, 2011). \\n \\nSelf-compassion is incredibly important (Neﬀ, 2011): \\u2028\\u2028\\nWe're a social species and are wired this way. It helps us feel better when others love and nurture us. We\\nrespond the same way to the love and nurturing that we can give ourselves by having a self-compassionate\\ninner voice.\\u2028\\nWhen you have diﬃculties, other people are not always around to provide compassion. But there's  one\\nperson who's always around — you. You’re always with yourself, 24/7, 365 days a year. So when you treat\\nyourself with loving kindness, it can make a big diﬀerence to your own mental health.\\u2028\\nStudies show that people who practice self-compassion have improved mental health and emotional\\nresilience, feel more connected to others, and suﬀer less depression, anxiety and self-criticism. \\u2028\\nDr. Kristin Neﬀ deﬁnes self-compassion as having three elements:\\nSelf-kindness: Being kind to yourself, as you might be towards a best friend, a loved one, a child or a\\nbeloved pet. Self-compassion is the opposite of being self-critical. \\u2028\\nCommon humanity: Knowing that you're not alone, we're all simply human, and we all experience suﬀering\\nand personal failure. No one is human without hurting or failing at something at least some of the time. Self-\\ncompassion means knowing you're not unique, special or better than others. \\u2028\\nMindfulness: Accepting and acknowledging your feelings and thoughts without judgement, rather than\\nsuppressing them. Self-compassion is the opposite of ignoring your feelings or trying to push them down. \\u2028\\nSelf-compassion is part of many traditional practices such as Buddhism. In the Western world, we're starting to\\nrealize that self-compassion can be incredibly helpful for the issues seen in modern society.\\nWhy Self-Compassion May Be More Important Than Self-Esteem\\n“If you don’t love yourself, you cannot love others. You will not be able to love others. If you have no compassion\\nfor yourself, then you will not be able to develop true compassion for others.” \\n \\n— Dalai Lama\\n \\nThere has been a lot of attention to improving self-esteem, as studies show that low self-esteem is often seen in\\nproblems like depression and anxiety. \\n \\nOne of the ways to boost low self-esteem in Western society is to cheer people up by telling them that they are\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Self-Compassion.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Page 3 / 7\\nspecial and unique, sometimes by pointing out that they are better than others at something.\\n \\nHere’s an example:\\u2028\\u2028\\nYour friend: “I’m so sad, I failed my math test.”\\u2028\\nYou: “I’m so sorry! Well, on the bright side, you are awesome at music. I wish I was as good at music as you\\nwere.”\\u2028\\n However, there's a problem with this approach: \\nCheering ourselves up through comparisons relies on us being better than others in that area, and this\\ncannot always be the case. It’s a statistical impossibility for us all to be better than others — let’s face it,\\nmost people are “normal”.\\u2028\\nWe don’t permit ourselves to really feel sad and ‘grieve’ the loss that we're experiencing.\\u2028\\nSome people start believing they’re special and better than others, which can lead to being self-centred,\\nnarcissistic and self-critical. \\u2028\\nWhat’s the solution?\\n \\nThe good news is that self-compassion oﬀers another way to feel better about ourselves. It’s self-sustainable and\\nlong lasting, and in the end, it leads to good self-esteem.\\n \\nHere's how to foster self-compassion in a loved one:\\u2028\\u2028\\nYour loved one: “I’m so sad. I failed my math test.”\\u2028\\nYou: “I’m so sorry! That’s upsetting.” \\u2028\\nYour loved one: “Yeah, I studied so hard, and I still failed.”\\u2028\\nYou: “How can I be helpful? Want to talk about it?”\\u2028\\nYour loved one: “It’s okay — I appreciate you asking.”\\u2028\\nYou: “You know I’m always here for you... even if you’re not a math genius.”\\u2028\\nBeneﬁts of Self-Compassion \\nStudies on people that practice self-compassion show the following: \\nThey are more likely to take responsibility for their actions and not blame others, showing that self-\\ncompassion is not simply letting yourself oﬀ the hook. \\nThey are more likely to study more after a disappointing result\\nTheir self-compassion connects them with the rest of humanity while the emphasis on always having to be\\nbetter than others disconnects you from others\\nVeterans that harness their “inner ally” are more likely to recover more quickly than those who focus on\\ntheir inner enemy.\\nWhere Does Our Self-Critical Inner Voice Come From?\\nThere are many reasons that you may ﬁnd yourself being self-critical:\\nYou may have grown up experiencing critical voices at home, for example:\\u2028\\nParent: “You won’t get anywhere in life if you don’t do better.” “You’re going to be a failure!”\\u2028\\u2028\\nIf we were raised with parents who were often critical, then we may often be critical ourselves. Most\\nof the time, even critical parents have good intentions, wanting to help us by pushing us harder. They\\nsimply didn't realize that criticism often creates the opposite eﬀect.\\u2028\\n \\nModern society is judgmental and critical. From an early age, children attend school, and school teaches\\nthem that their self-worth is based on their behaviour and achievements. With their peers, students learn\\nthat ﬁtting in and being accepted by your peers is not about being yourself, but about being a certain way.\\u2028\\n \", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Self-Compassion.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

You may worry that if you start accepting\\nor forgiving yourself, then you won’t be pushing yourself to do better.  The truth, however, is that when\\nyou’re overly self-critical, it drains your mental energy, leaving you less mental energy to succeed or carry\\non. \\nHow To Be Self-Compassionate\\nThe next time that you have a loss (such as a breakup in a relationship, or problems with work or school)  or face\\nsuﬀering (such as having a medical problem, or mental health issues such as depression or anxiety)... \\n \\nDo the following: \\n \\n•\\nIdentify and express how you’re feeling.\\u2028• If you’re feeling sad and upset, then simply say to yourself, “I’m\\nsad and upset about this.”\\u2028\\n• If you’re feeling angry, then accept that there are usually feelings\\nunderneath the anger, for example, “I’m angry, because I’m\\nactually sad about…”\\u2028\\n• If you feel like crying, then allow the tears to come out. Although\\nmany of us (especially men) may have learned to suppress our\\nfeelings and not cry, crying is actually one of the most powerful\\nways for our brains to cope with a disappointment or loss, and then\\nbe able to move on with things.\\u2028\\n•\\nAccept and validate how you’re feeling.• “It’s okay to feel this way. There’s nothing wrong with feeling like\\nthis, because other people would feel sad and upset about this\\ntoo.”\\u2028\\n•\\nRemind yourself that you’re not alone but\\ninstead, precisely because of this, are\\nconnected to what others experience.\\u2028• “I’m not the only person who has stuﬀ like this happen.”\\u2028\\n• “This is just part of being human. Everyone feels this way at some\\npoint.”\\u2028\\n• “I’m only human. Nobody has a perfect life.”  \\n•\\nRemind yourself that the fact you’re in pain\\ndoesn’t mean you’re bad.\\u2028• “This doesn’t make me a bad person. I’m simply human and\\nimperfect, just like everyone else.”\\u2028\\n•\\nGive yourself hope • “It’s going to be okay.”\\u2028\\n• “I’m going to get through this.”  \\u2028\\n•\\nTell yourself the same  thing that you’d say\\nto comfort someone you care about.\\u2028• “I’m a good person.”\\u2028\\n• “I’m not alone.”\\u2028\\n•\\nBe grateful for what you have. This helps you\\nthink about positives and counter the natural\\nhuman tendency to be negative.\\u2028• “I’m fortunate to have ____”\\u2028\\n• “I’m lucky that ___”\\n•\\nMove on and do helpful things.\\u2028• “I’m not going to make myself feel worse. I’m going to support\\nmyself like I’d support someone else going through this.”\\u2028\\n• “There are some healthy things I can do about this, like get to\\nbed earlier, eat healthier and get outside every day.”\\u2028\\nSelf-Compassion Exercises\\nAre you ﬁnding self-compassion hard? Consider this exercise from Dr. Kristin Neﬀ. Studies have shown that doing\\neven just a week of daily self-compassion exercises such as the following can lead to improved mental health, even\\nmonths later.

Unfortunately, even if the person feels temporarily better,\\nself-harm behaviours do not work in the long run. They may worsen the situation by leading to\\nguilt, shame, embarrassment or stresses with one\\'s loved ones. Parents and caregivers can\\nsupport their loved one with self-harm by validating, empathizing and accepting their loved\\none’s distressing feelings. And when their loved one is ready, one might work with them to ﬁnd\\nalternate ways to cope with their distress.\\nMary\\'s Story\\nMary is a 14-yo teenager who has always been somewhat quiet and shy, so her mother was surprised when she\\nfound out that Mary started dating a boy this school year. But lately, Mary\\'s been a lot moodier than usual. And just\\nthe other day, Mary\\'s mother caught a glimpse of Mary\\'s forearms and saw that they had scratches and cuts all\\nover them. Like most parents would feel in such a situation, Mary\\'s mother felt suddenly scared and confused, and\\nthought to herself \"This is terrible! I\\'ve no idea how to deal with this! What am I supposed to do!\"\\nWhat is Self-Harm?\\nSelf-harm is the deliberate attempt to harm oneself and in most cases, is done without consciously trying to end\\none\\'s life. (The oﬃcial term is non-suicidal self-harm (NSSH)). \\n \\nThe most common type of self-harm behaviour is self-injury, which is the deliberate damaging of one\\'s body, such\\nas by self-cutting; scratching or burning one\\'s skin, \"minor\" overdosing of medications (taking excess amounts of\\nmedications but not enough to kill oneself) and banging one\\'s head against a wall.\\nWho Self-Harms?\\nSelf-injury behaviours start on average at age 15, and is most commonly seen in teenagers and young adults. In\\none study of Canadian youth aged 14-21, 17% were shown to have self-harmed, and it is twice as common in\\nfemales (21%) than in males (8.7%) (Nixon et al., 2008).\\nWhy Do People Self-Harm?\\nIt is believed that people self-harm in order to regulate how they feel, such as coping with stress (or boredom).\\nPeople who self-harm often report they do so in order to: ', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Self-Harm Behaviours in Children and Youth_ Information for Parents and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

The good news, is that there are many other ways to\\ncope and manage with diﬃcult feelings and stresses.\\nWhat is self-harm?\\nSelf-harm is when people purposely try to hurt themselves. Common ways of self-harm include:\\nSelf-cutting\\nScratching or burning one\\'s skin\\n\"Minor\" overdosing of medications (taking excess amounts of medications but not enough to kill oneself)\\nHead banging (banging one\\'s head against a wall).Who Self-Harms?\\nPeople of all ages may self-harm, though self-injury behaviours start on average at age 15, and is most commonly\\nseen in teenagers and young adults. \\nWhy do people self-harm?\\nIt is believed that people self-harm in order to cope or deal with some stress. Some of the reasons given include:\\nGetting relief from painful or distressing feelings\\nDealing with feelings of numbness\\nCommunicating pain or distress to others\\nThe good news, is that people with self-harm are trying to cope; the bad news, is that self-harm is usually not a\\nhelpful way to cope... \\nI want to understand why I hurt myself...\\nAsk yourself these questions to help you better understand the feelings or situations that lead to self-injury\\n(Kilburn & Whitlock, 2009):\\nWhat was going on in my life when I ﬁrst began to injure myself?', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Self-Harming_ Information for Adults.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

We need to be able to experience our emotions, but\\nwe also need to be able to manage them. It’s hard to make good decisions if emotions take over. We can\\nlearn to handle sadness, worry and anger, without letting these feelings control us. There are things you can\\ndo to make yourself feel a little better. When you are feeling sad, anxious, stressed or angry, try things that\\nwill distract or relax you: \\nArts and crafts \\nExercise (walking outside, yoga, any physical activity you enjoy) \\nPlaying or listening to music \\nWatching a funny movie \\nTaking a bath or singin in the shower \\nDeep breathing \\nMeditation \\nHanging our with friends (and not talking about the things stressing you) \\nCleaning your room \\nJournal writing \\nReading \\nHobbies \\nNote that not all these strategies will work for everyone. Try a few to see which ones work for you!\\nImprove problem solving skills \\nYou really can develop skills to give you more control over situations and improve things. It’s always easier\\nto handle things if you break them down into smaller bits ﬁrst. You might ﬁnd this a helpful way to work\\nthrough a problem in a positive way. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. Writing things down may also help you\\nto organize your thoughts a little better.

What would you like things to be like? Having a goal in mind will really help you get there, but\\nmake sure your goal is realistic. You may not be able to get an A+ in math.

Keep track of the actions you’re taking. This can help you see the\\nprogress you’re making. Plan some little ‘rewards’ for yourself, for sticking to your plan. It’s OK to make\\nmistakes-everyone slides a bit when trying to make a change. Learn from it, and move on. \\n \\nReﬂect. Think about what’s working and what’s not working. Be sure to pay attention to the things that\\nmay be getting better. Ask yourself: \\nIs your goal realistic? \\nWhat part of the plan am I having trouble with?\\nDo you need:\\nMore time? \\nMore support? \\nA diﬀerent plan?\\nCommunicate eﬀectively. Learning to communicate more eﬀectively can help you solve problems and\\nhave better relationships. Speaking up can also help you reach out when things hurt so much that you need\\nto take it out on yourself. For things to get better, you’ll need to share your struggles with others, and ask\\nfor help. You can do this face to face, but you can also write a letter. Being a good communicator will help\\nyou get your needs met. When talking about anything that’s bothering you, try ‘DEAR’, below. It will help\\nyou share what’s on your mind and help you to solve problems. \\nDescribe the current situation. Try to stick to the facts.\\nE.g. “This semester has been pretty rough.” \\n \\nExpress- your feelings and opinions about the situation by using \"I\" messages.  Using “I-\\nmessages” is the best way to get your points across, and can prevent the other person from reacting\\ndefensively. “I” messages are ways of expressing yourself, that begin with “I”. They are a respectful way to\\nget your point across, without threatening others.\\nE.g. “I feel overloaded and overwhelmed by all of this school work. I get stressed when you compare me to\\nmy brother.\"\\n \\nAsk for what you want or need.  \\nE.g. “I was hoping I could get some help to prepare for this next test.” / \"I was hoping you could just listen to\\nhow I feel; I don\\'t want any advice, but just someone to listen.\" \"I was wondering if you could stop\\ncomparing me to my brother.\"\\nReinforce by telling the person how they can help you. Help them feel good ahead of time for supporting\\nyou.\\nE.g. “I know how busy you are, and I really appreciate your help.” \\nMy story part 2... \\nWell, my worst fear happened.

Aﬀected individuals may be overwhelmed by what\\notherwise appears normal amounts of sensory input (i.e. normal noise, light or touch) to others.\\nRecognizing when someone has sensory processing problems is important because there are\\nways to recognize sensory triggers, and provide a healthier 'sensory diet'.\\nIntroduction\\nA boy is so sensitive to being touched that he can't stand being hugged or touched, his parents even need to cut\\ntags oﬀ his clothing. A girl is so sensitive to noise that when it gets loud, she starts to cry or have tantrums.\\nAnother girl needs to move constantly to the point where teachers and other students ﬁnd her constant moving\\ndisruptive. What's up with these children? Are they simply being oppositional or diﬃcult children? Is it bad\\nparenting? Or could it be something else...\\nSensory Processing Problems\\nSensory processing problems is a complex condition where a person misinterprets information from the senses,\\nsuch as touch, sound and movement.\\n \\nWe are all constantly taking in information from our senses.\\n \\nTypes of sensory input include:\\nVisual  or vision input: What you see\\nAuditory or sound  input: What you hear\\nTactile  or touch input: What you feel through touching, or through your skin, etc.\\nOlfactory  input : What you smell\\nGustatory input: What you taste , such as when you eat or drink\\nVestibular or movement input : What you feel when  you are moving, such as your arms, legs or your\\nbody\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Sensory Processing Problems.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 5\\nThese senses all work together to allow us to carry on our daily activities. It becomes so automatic, that we don\\'t\\neven think about it, but we are processing sensory input every single moment.\\n \\nOur sensory preferences are quite individual. Remember the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears and what\\nhappens when she tries the porridge? The ﬁrst one was \"too cold\". The second was \"too hot\". But luckily, the last\\none was \"just right\".\\n \\nWhen we are able to process sensory input eﬃciently, our nervous systems regulate input without eﬀort. We feel\\n\"just right\". When in this \"just right\" state of arousal, we are calm, alert, focused and ready to work and learn.\\nWhat Do Sensory Processing Problems Look Like?\\nCommon types of sensory processing problems include:\\n \\n1. Sensory Defensiveness\\n \\nThese are kids whose nervous systems feel sensation easily or intensely and they become overwhelmed from too\\nmuch sensory information. For these children, things feel too loud, too fast, or too bright .\\n \\nDiﬀerent types of sensory sensitivities include:\\nTouch / tactile hypersensitivity : Easily overwhelmed with touch input, such as tags on clothing or food\\ntextures that are either too mushy or too crunchy, leading to being a picky eater.\\nVisual hypersensitivity : Easily over-stimulated by visual input, such as ﬂuorescent or bright lighting or\\nenvironments with a lot of visual input, such as classrooms, malls and fairs.\\nVestibular hypersensitivity: (things tend to get \"too fast\"): Tends to feel movement too intensely and thus may\\neasily feel car sick or be afraid of activities where one\\'s feet leave the ground, and dislike ladders or amusement\\npark rides.\\nAuditory hypersensitivity : Gets easily upset by noise created by home appliances, lawnmowers or school\\nbuses or noise occurring within a classroom or school assembly setting. Individuals who are hypersensitive\\nto sounds may sometimes create noise (e.g. making their own noises or making white noise) in an attempt\\nto drown out other distressing noises.\\nFight, Flight or Freeze Response\\n \\nWhen a child is overwhelmed by sensory input their responses may include:\\nFight  - anger, irritability, tantrums or explosive rages.\\nFlight  - panic, running away or withdrawal.\\nFreeze - where a child is so overwhelmed that the child simply is unable to speak or move.\\n2. Sensory-Seeking Children\\n \\nThese are children whose nervous systems crave more sensory input, and they may seem almost like they have an\\ninsatiable desire for sensory stimulation. For example, they may seek out movement stimulation rocking on their\\nchairs. They may seek out oral motor stimulation by chewing on their shirts. Those who are unable to meet their\\nown sensory needs may complain of ‘being bored\\'.\\n \\n3. Sensory Under-Responsive Children\\n \\nSensory Under-Responsive kids appear sedentary and passive. They do not actively seek out sensory stimulation\\nand may appear lethargic and unmotivated when completing their daily activities. These children may need\\nsigniﬁcantly increased sensory input in order to register the information. For example, having the child take part in\\na body break before sitting to learn and hands on learning.\\n \\nPoor Motor Coordination\\n ', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Sensory Processing Problems.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 3 / 5\\nDue to diﬃculties processing sensory information, many children with sensory processing issues may present as\\nclumsy and awkward in their day to day life. For example, the child who has a weak grasp because his tactile\\nsystem under registers the information. Other examples would be diﬃculties with stairs, bicycle riding and skating.\\nA Few Words about Diagnosis\\nAt the moment, there is poor awareness about sensory processing problems because the condition is not (yet) a\\nrecognized condition under the DSM (Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Diseases). However, there is a\\nmovement underway to have sensory processing problems oﬃcially recognized as a condition, under the term,\\n‘Sensory Processing Disorders\\'.  \\n \\nSensory processing problems can be seen alone but are often seen along with other conditions such as Attention\\nDeﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder, Developmental Disorders, Learning Disabilities or Autistic Spectrum Conditions.\\nIf You Suspect Sensory Processing Problems\\nBring your child to a family physician (or paediatrician) to make sure that there are no contributing medical\\nproblems. Although the doctor can rule out contributory medical problems, note that many doctors may not be all\\nthat aware of sensory processing problems.\\n \\nThe next step would be an evaluation by an Occupational Therapist (OT), in which the OT meets with the child and\\nparents. This meeting typically involves obtaining: a sensory history since birth, developmental history, current\\nsymptoms and function, and completion of a variety of parent-report measures related to the functional impact of\\nsensory processing diﬃculties. In addition, the child may be evaluated using a standardized assessment, and\\nreactions to sensory input and coordination and motor abilities will be clinically observed.\\nHow are Sensory Processing Issues treated?\\nAt most publicly funded facilities in Canada (such as Children\\'s Hospitals), sensory processing issues are addressed\\nby OTs using the following methods:\\n \\n1. Environmental Adaptations and Accommodations, such as:\\nAllow a child with sound sensitivity to sit away from the busy door in the classroom\\nCut tags out of clothing for a touch sensitive child\\nWork out a way to ﬁgure out when the child is getting sensory over-stimulated, and then give the child a\\nsoothing space to go to in order to calm down\\n2. Suggestions for Interaction\\n \\nFor example, for a child who requires extra sensory input in order to focus, use multi-sensory input such as:\\nVoice (e.g. talking, sound, music)\\nVisual (e.g. drawings, pictures)\\nManipulatives (objects that a child can physical handle or ﬁdget with, such as ‘stress balls\\', etc.)\\n3. Activities embedded into daily routines/Sensory Diets\\n \\nThe child takes part in regular calming or alerting activities to help them maintain optimal alertness for daily\\nroutines.\\n \\nExamples of such activities might include:\\nJumping on a mini trampoline in the morning to help wake up\\nDoing some \"heavy muscle work\" to calm down before going to the dentist\\nIdeally, the child\\'s treatment plan would be created with a qualiﬁed Occupational Therapist.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Sensory Processing Problems.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Some people have a higher than usual need for oral sensory input, to the point\\nthat it can cause problems from destroying pens, pencils, clothing or other items. The good\\nnews is that many things can be done to help. It is usually not helpful to simply punish the\\nbehaviour, as the behaviour is meant to self-regulate. The solution includes ﬁnding out what is\\nunderneath the behaviour. Are they bored and understimulated and trying to increase\\nstimulation? Are they overwhelmed and stressed? If so, how can we address their stress. And\\nthen we can replace the not so helpful oral behaviours with more helpful ways to self-regulate. It\\nmight be providing alternative means of oral sensory input (e.g. safe yet indestructible things to\\nchew on, chewy or crunchy foods, etc.), as well as other types of organizing and calming sensory\\ninput (e.g. tactile, deep pressure, movement, or others).\\nJ’s Story\\nJ. is a 7-yo child who chews on everything. At school, he destroys pencils and pens by chewing on them, which\\nleads the teachers to get upset. It makes him shunned by others due to pandemic worries about germs. At home,\\nhe chews on his toys, his bedsheets, his clothes.\\nIt is to the point where parents have to constantly replace items at home, causing ﬁnancial stress on the family.\\nParents have tried all sorts of consequences and punishment to get J. to stop chewing things, but nothing seems to\\nwork.\\nWhat now?\\nSigns of Oral Seeking\\nAre there any of the following signs of strong oral needs such as excessive:\\nSucking or chewing on shirts and clothing?\\nSeeking out strong or extreme food ﬂavours, e.g. extreme sweet, extreme sour, etc.?', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Sensory Processing_ Helping Children Youth who are Oral Seeking.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

For example, an infant that is upset, and calms when given breast milk to suck and drink;\\nor when given a soother to suck.\\nAs humans get older, chewing, sucking and biting meets sensory needs, even when people are not hungry or\\nthirsty.\\nOral sensory input is powerful and unique because:\\nIt helps when we are bored or understimulated. Oral sensory input provides suﬃcient stimulation to “feeling\\ncalm, “just right”, back “in the green zone”.\\nExample\\nChild who is bored in class, and chews on their pencil.\\nIt helps when we are stressed or overstimulated. Oral sensory input is calming and helps people calm down\\nto be “just right”, back “in the green zone”.\\nExample\\nAdult who is stressed out at work, and chews on their pen when stressed.\\nOral sensory input is unique in that it can be helpful whether people are under or overstimulated. Not all sensory\\ninputs are like this. For example, while many people like background music when they are bored, most people do\\nnot want more background music or noise when they are upset.\\nWhy Do Some People Need to Constantly Chew, Suck or Bite on Things?\\nWhile it is normal for everyone to have oral sensory / motor needs, some people seem to have a higher need.\\nThis can be due to many reasons including:\\nThe person is under stress, and is trying to self-regulate with oral sensory/motor input. After all, oral sensory\\n/motor input is one of the most eﬀective ways to self-regulation.\\nThe person is understimulated, not stressed or overstimulated, and needs more sensory input.\\nWhen understimulated, people may appear bored, and have troubles paying attention.\\nThey might have oral hyposensitivity, i.e. their oral system is under sensitive to oral sensory input.\\nExamples\\nThey may not notice that they have enough food in their mouth, and so they may be stuﬃng\\ntheir mouth too full.\\nThey be constantly putting things in their mouth, even when they are not hungry.\\nA study with university students actually showed that chewing cinnamon gum improved how students did on a\\ntest.

Fortunately, there are things that parents can do that can help children and\\nyouth cope better with a separation and divorce.\\nIntroduction\\nSeparation and divorce happens.\\nIn North America, close to 40% of relationships eventually end up in separation or divorce within 15-years (Kreider\\net al., 2002; Department of Justice, 1997).\\nOn one hand, separation and divorce can be extremely stressful for children and youth:\\nLack of control: Their family, as they know it, is changing profoundly in so many ways, and they have no\\ncontrol over the situation.\\nBlame, guilt and shame: In order to gain a sense of being in control, some children may blame themselves.\\nOverwhelmed parents may also wrongly blame children when upset. Any of this is a massive burden for a\\nchild to take on. \\nChanges in routine: There are generally changes in routine, where children live, when they see each parent.\\nAny change in routine can be very stressful, especially for younger children or for those who have a hard\\ntime with change.\\nFears of abandonment: Children may fear that parents are leaving each other, and as a result, parents could\\nleave the child too. In far too many situations, this is a justiﬁed fear.\\nConﬂict between parents: Any conﬂict, tension and ﬁghting between parents is really hard for children and\\nyouth. Every child wants to be able to love both their parents. Conﬂict can make them feel that they have to\\nchoose sides. Or may them upset at both parents for ﬁghting.\\nParents may be more stressed and less available emotionally and physically. Being a single parent is\\nchallenging, as the parent on their own has to provide for the household’s needs (e.g. income, housing,\\nfood). Running a household alone generally leaves less time much time for children and youth as before. Or\\nwhen the parent is available, they may be exhausted and emotionally drained.\\nOn the other hand, there can be many beneﬁts. There are many situations where parents should separate and\\ndivorce. When separation and divorce reduces conﬂict between parents, then the children and youth may beneﬁt\\nin the long run. Less conﬂict generally leads to happier parents, which can then allow children and youth to have\\nhappier and healthier relationships with parents and other family members.\\nTerms\\nSeparation:\\nLegal separation is when a couple decides to live apart from each other. The law recognizes couples as', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Separation and Divorce.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 6\\nlegally separated if the couple tells family and friends that they are separated.\\nDivorce:\\nThis is a process that oﬃcially ends a marriage. In a divorce, spouses must divide their property and make\\narrangements for child custody, alimony and settlement of debts. In Canada, a couple can ﬁle for divorce if\\nthey have been separated for at least one year.\\nAre You Thinking about Separation?\\nIs there any possibility of working things out?\\nIf so, would it be helpful to speak with a marriage or family counsellor, to help work through the pros and\\ncons.\\nThere are certain situations where a couple should separate. Examples include:\\nEmotional, physical or sexual abuse by a parent, towards either the other parent or the children.\\nLegal grounds for divorce include:\\nLiving apart for at least one year;\\nAdultery (cheating)\\nPhysical or mental cruelty.\\nYou’ve Decided You Want to Separate… Now What?\\nOnce you or your partner decide to separate or divorce, you’ll both have to think about the following things:\\nWhat is happening with the parental home;\\nWhere is each parent going to live, and who do they live with;\\nHow your child(ren) will be cared for and where they will live\\nWho will make decisions for your child(ren)\\nFinancial support, including child support and spousal support\\nHow you will divide property\\nIdeally, you will have a plan for the above things before you break the news to your children.\\nBreaking the News About Separation/Divorce to the Children\\nThink about a good time for both parents to meet with the children.\\nThere is no perfect time, but a less bad time might be Friday after school.\\nBad times would be important events or anniversaries, e.g. a child’s birthday, Christmas, etc. Separation/\\ndivorce is a stressful conversation, and it is usually best to not have them associate separation/divorce with\\ntheir birthday, for example.\\nHow to break the news\\nMeet your children together with your spouse.\\nConsider the “sandwich technique”, where you start with something positive, then the negative, then ﬁnish\\nwith positive.\\nGood news: \\nTell them that as their parents, you love them very much and nothing will ever change that.\\nBad news\\nTell them that you have something diﬃcult to tell them and that you have made a decision to\\nseparate / divorce.\\nExplain it is not the children’s fault.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Separation and Divorce.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 3 / 6\\nGood news\\nTell them that this is for the best, as there will be less tension and stress between parents,\\nthat you will both continue to be their parents; that you will both continue being connected\\nwith them.\\nOther details to review include:\\nLiving arrangements\\nTell them where each parent will be living.\\nWith younger children, parents will need to decide where children live. With younger children, they\\nwill usually live with their primary caregiver. Don’t make younger children have to decide about\\nwhere to live as this causes unnecessary stress on them.\\nWith teenagers and young adults, who have increased needs for autonomy, you will want to see if\\nthey have a preference, and respect that preference if possible.\\nTry to come up with the same expectations and rules for both households. Children and youth do best\\nwith consistent limits and structure.\\nWork out a regular schedule of visits, when children will be with each parent.\\nMake sure your children have private space for their things in each household. Try to keep essentials\\nin each house (like toothbrushes, toiletries and school supplies) so children and youth won’t have the\\nstress of always having to “live out of a suitcase”.\\nSchool\\nWill they be staying at the same school or going to a diﬀerent school.\\nTips on Co-Parenting\\nAfter the separation/divorce, parents shift into a new relationship, that of being co-parents.\\nCommunication Tips \\nUse a communication book to make sure that children’s school commitments and activities (like birthday\\nparties or sports) are shared between both parents. This can also make it easier to communicate if diﬃcult\\nfeelings (like hurt, anger, or jealousy) tend to come out when the parents interact in person.\\nRelationship Tips \\nMake sure that each child gets to spend regular one-on-one time with each parent. One-on-one time is\\nimportant. This is when children and youth are most likely to express their true feelings, giving you the\\nchance to listen and support your children.\\nTry to see your relationship with your former partner as a professional, business-like, co-parenting\\nrelationship. Focus on the present: Co-parenting the children. Don’t focus on the past: Talking about past\\nhurts and resentments usually doesn’t resolve anything and just brings up pain.\\nKeep the children out of any conﬂict between parents. Involving children in parent’s conﬂicts, or wanting\\nthem to take sides is harmful to the children.\\nBe assertive (and not aggressive or hostile) when interacting with your former partner.\\nFor example…\\nInstead of… Try instead…\\n• Getting angry with your former partner if they are\\noften late.Share how you feel or how it aﬀects you (or the children), e.g.\\n“When you’re late picking up the kids, they get very worried\\nthat they’ll be late for school. And it makes me late for work”, or\\n“I ﬁnd it very diﬃcult to make plans when you don’t drop the\\nkids oﬀ when you said you would.”\\nMake the request. Politely, calmly and respectfully request what\\nyou’d like, e.g. “Would it possible for you to…” “I need you\\nto…” “I was hoping ….” “I would appreciate it if you could…”\\nIs your other partner simply unreasonable? If so, reach out to your support network.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Separation and Divorce.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

When parents are overwhelmed, our childrens’ needs can become\\noverlooked. However, meeting their needs now through this diﬃcult time, it will actually make your life\\neasier in the long run by ensuring that they are healthy and coping the best they can.\\nAre you ﬁnding it diﬃcult to meet their needs because you are too overwhelmed? \\nIf so, then reach out to your family, friends. Ask them for their support to help you out, or to help out\\nwith the children.\\nAre you still struggling? \\nConsider reaching out to a professional, e.g. family physician, counsellor.\\nDo accept your children’s feelings.\\nAre the children angry at their parents? Accept their anger. Underneath the anger is sadness at this\\nmassive change in their lives.\\nEmpathize, validate, accept: “What I get from you is that you are feeling very angry. I can see why\\nyou might feel this way. I accept that.”\\nOﬀer support based on what they need: “I’m here for you. If you need space, I’ll give you space. If\\nyou want to talk, I’m here to listen. Or we can just sit together without talking. Whatever you need.”\\nDon’ts\\nDon’t ask younger children to decide which parent to stay with. It puts too much pressure on them by\\nforcing them to choose between parents. In general, young children should be with whichever parent was\\nthe primary caregiver.\\nDon’t say bad things about the other parent (whether true or not), or blame the other parent in front of your\\nchild. You may be feeling hurt, upset and angry at the other parent, and it might be tempting to vent your\\nfrustrations in front of your child or teen. This can be very harmful to children for a few reasons:\\nChildren want and need to have a positive relationship with both parents. A child who has a poor\\nrelationship with one parent is more likely to have poor self-esteem and problems with trust.\\nIf you are blaming, negative and critical, this negative energy can have a negative impact on your\\nrelationship with your child. If the other parent stays calm, then you end up looking bad. If the other\\nparent retaliates, conﬂict gets worse, which is also stresses your child or teen.\\nDon’t discuss ﬁnancial issues with your children or youth. Separation and divorce are costly, and parents\\nmay feel tempted to share these issues with their children. Unfortunately, telling children and youth about\\nﬁnancial stresses may end up making them feel more nervous and insecure. Instead, tell your children that\\nthe adults are in charge, and they will take care of the ﬁnancial issues.\\nDon’t expect your children to be little adults. For example, do not tell your son, “You’re the man of the\\nhouse now.”\\nLiving Away from Your Children?\\nAfter the separation/divorce, are you living away from your children?\\nIf so, it is still very important to still be a part of their lives. The more you can invest in their lives now when they\\nare young, the greater your investment will pay oﬀ in the long run, for everyone involved.\\nChildren and youth need and want both parents in their lives. When parents are not involved in their children’s\\nlives, children may feel that they are unloved.\\nThis can lead to sadness, anxiety, and troubles with self-acceptance, and can lead to long-term problems in their\\nlives.\\nThe good news is that there are many things that you can do such as:\\nMake the eﬀort to see them regularly. There is no more powerful way of saying “I love you” than by seeing\\nyour child regularly.\\nConnect with them regularly: If it is not possible to see them regularly, at least connect with your child often\\nin other ways such as social media, send letters, texts, emails, talk on the phone or skype. Regular contact\\nis another way to say, “You’re important to me, and I love you.”', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Separation and Divorce.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 5 / 6\\nKeep your promises. If you make promises to your child, then keep them. If you have made plans to visit\\nwith your child, then do not cancel those plans at the last minute.\\nRemind your children that they are important. Send letters and pictures that your children can keep to\\nremind them about your relationship. Remember important days. Learn about their friends and activities.\\nCelebrate holidays and birthdays with your child as often as possible.\\nWhen Parents Start Seeing Other People\\nWhen parents start seeing other people after a separation/divorce, this can be very stressful for the children.\\nThey might:\\nFeel jealous because deep down, they are afraid that the new person will compete for your attention.\\nDo reassure your children by telling them that friends and new romantic partners will 1) never replace a\\nparent’s love for their children, nor will 2) the partner replace the other parent.\\nDo make sure that dating does not take away from the time and relationship that you have with your\\nchildren -- remember, that your children come ﬁrst.\\nDo accept if your child is feeling jealous or upset when you start dating. Help them process and accept this\\nthrough empathy, validation, acceptance. You might say: “What I get from you is that you are upset about\\n___. That’s natural. Sometimes people feel upset because they are worried about ___, or scared about ____. “\\nDo’s\\nDon’ts\\nDon’t get upset with your child or teen if he becomes jealous when you begin dating. Children naturally are\\nafraid that they will lose the aﬀection and love of a parent who is sharing some of their time and aﬀection\\nwith someone else.\\nDon’t introduce your new partner to your children until the relationship looks like a serious, longer-term\\nrelationship. It is very stressful for children and youth to be exposed to several, diﬀerent romantic partners.\\nWhen to Seek Professional Help\\nSeparation and divorce is not an easy process to go through. \\nAre you ﬁnding yourself overwhelmed?\\nIf so, then reach out to your family, friend and support network, including health professionals.\\nIs your partner abusive, neglect or completely unreasonable?\\nConsider reaching out to health professionals as well as domestic violence / abuse services.\\nResources\\nBooks for parents\\nMom’s House, Dad’s House: Making Two Homes for Your Child, by Isolina Ricci\\nThe Coparenting Toolkit, Isolina Ricci\\nBooks for children and youth\\nWhat happens next?

There may be one that works at your doctor’s clinic or hospital. Otherwise, there are\\nregistered dieticians that you can pay privately to see for a consultation session.\\nIn general, people need to reduce 500–1,000 kcal/daily from their current diet, as well as make sure that\\nless than 30% of calories come from dietary fat.\\nConsider intermittent fasting\\nIntermittent fasting is a method used since antiquity, and which has been receiving more attention recently\\n(Patterson, 2015). It involves eating meals within a window of time in a day (such as 8 hrs each 24 hr day),\\nand during the other period (such as 16 hrs each 24-hr day) , you don’t eat, which burns energy and keeps\\nyour body from storing energy as fat. A typical “16/8 intermittent fasting” schedule might be:\\nEating meals only between 8 AM to 4 PM.\\nEating meals only between 10 AM to 6 PM, or\\nEating meals only between 12 - 8 PM, or\\nIncrease your physical activity.\\nIf you are eating more, then consider increasing your physical activity.\\nStart small. Find an activity you like, and do it. The easiest is going for a walk, or a bike ride.\\nThe typical goal is at least 150 minutes of moderate (55%–69% of the maximum heart rate) exercise\\nweekly, which is only about 20-minutes a day...

Eat purposely when it is a mealtime by eating at the kitchen or dining room table.\\nDon’t eat mindlessly. Don’t eat at other times such as watching TV, standing at the fridge, reading in bed,\\nworking on the computer, etc.\\nEliminate sources of temptation. Don’t buy junk foods or snack foods for the home such as bags of chips,\\ncookies, ice cream, etc. If you absolutely want to have a treat, go out and get bag of chips at the corner\\nstore, or go out for ice cream at the ice cream place.\\nHave healthy snacks cut up and ready to eat such as\\nVegetables, e.g. carrots, cucumbers, celery, broccoli.\\nFruit, e.g. apples, oranges, bananas.\\nNuts, e.g. roasted, low salt almonds, peanuts, etc.\\nDairy, e.g. low sugar yogurt.\\nEverything in moderation -- if you eat too much healthy snacks (e.g. several apples), that’s not good\\neither.

Some people\\nuse instruments such as tweezers, pins, scissors or knives\\nAfter picking the skin, the person feels a temporary relief from emotional distress and urge.\\nPeople may spent large amounts of time picking their skin picking, often several hours per day, and worse in\\nthe evenings.\\nThe behaviour can happen when you aren’t even consciously aware of it, e.g. while watching TV. \\nPeople often try to resist or stop the behaviour, but it is diﬃcult.\\nPeople may be reluctant to show areas of damaged skin, thus will go to eﬀorts to hide the areas aﬀected.\\nMay cause problems in a person’s life at home, work or school, though many times, others may have no\\nidea.\\nWhy It Is Important to See a Doctor \\nIt is important to see a doctor, as medical conditions can contribute to skin picking, such as skin disorders (such as\\npsoriasis and scabies), and conditions such as low iron or liver problems can lead to itchy skin.\\nGetting help for skin picking disorder is important, as people with skin picking may be at risk of other conditions\\nsuch as depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and others. Getting help for these other\\nconditions can help with skin picking or vice-versa.\\nSelf-Help Strategies\\nSelf-Compassion\\nSelf-compassion is about accepting that you are imperfect. For many people, a trigger is seeing an imperfection in\\ntheir skin, which leads them to pick at it. Self-compassion helps us accept that there will always be imperfections in\\nour skin and body. And it's okay, because everyone is imperfect, and that is part of being human.\\nHave you just picked your skin and feel guilty about it? Unfortunately, self-blame makes us feel more stressed,\\nwhich doesn’t help. It’s not the end of the world. You are not alone. Many things can help.\\nHave a good skincare routine\\nWash your face once or twice a day. Many experts recommend washing in the morning and once at night to\\nremove dirt, makeup, oil or other grime. Use a mild soap to keep your face from getting too dry. Some people ﬁnd\\nthat water alone is enough, without using any soap.\\nUse a skin moisturizer to keep your skin well hydrated because some people ﬁnd that dry or itchy skin is a trigger.\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Skin Picking (aka Excoriation) Disorder.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Lack of sleep can cause a number of health problems. On the other hand, trouble\\nsleeping can also be a symptom of physical or mental health problems. This fact sheet will help\\nyou make sure your teen is getting a good night’s sleep.\\nHow Does Sleep Usually Happen? \\nThe brain has an internal clock that tells us when we need to sleep. When it becomes dark outside in the evening,\\nthis clock is triggered to make melatonin. Melatonin is a brain chemical that makes us feel sleepy. \\n \\nWhen youth reach adolescence, their sleep pattern changes. Their inner clocks shift, making them want to stay up\\nlater and sleep later the next morning. This can be diﬃcult if they have an early school start time. Even so, try to\\naccommodate this as far as possible. \\nHow Much Sleep Does My Child/Youth Need? \\nAge of Child (in Years) Amount of Sleep Needed\\nPreschoolers (aged 3-5 years) Usually 10-13 hrs, but may range 9-16 hrs depending on the child \\nSchool-aged children (aged 6-13) Usually 9-11 hrs, but may range 7-12 hrs depending on the child\\nAdolescent / teen (aged 14-17) Usually 8-10 hrs, but may range 7-11 hrs depending on the teen \\nYoung adult (aged 18-25) Usually 7-9 hrs, but may range from 6-11 hrs, depending on the person \\nWhat Happens When You Don't Get Enough Sleep? \\nAll sorts of problems can happen when children/youth don’t get enough sleep. Lack of sleep can cause: \\nMood problems (like irritability); \", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Sleep in Children and Youth_ Information for Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 4\\nTrouble concentrating; \\nHyperactivity. While adults usually feel tired and don’t have much energy when sleep deprived, youth can\\nbecome hyperactive. \\nPhysical health problems (like getting sick more often).\\nAs a result, sometimes children and youth appear to have depression, anxiety, or even attention deﬁcit\\nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but the real issue is that they have a sleep problem. \\nHow Can I Make Sure My Child/Youth Gets Enough Sleep? \\nHumans are a social species, and so it helps to ﬁrst make sure that your child feels safe in his/her relationship with\\nyou. When there are problems in our relationships, we do not feel safe, and this can make sleep more diﬃcult.\\n \\nYounger children have a strong need to be close to a parent, especially at bedtime. This may be the result\\nof how humans have evolved over time. Thousands of years ago, sleep and separation from parents could\\nmean danger from predators. Being with parents meant safety. As children grow older, they still need this\\nconnection to parents, but this gradually changes into a need to be emotionally attached. \\n \\nThis need for physical closeness can return, though, when teens are feeling a lot of stress. Teens may even\\nsurprise their unsuspecting parents with crawling into bed with them. But this can be a good thing, and\\nshows a teen’s healthy need to reconnect at a diﬃcult time. One of the best ways to help youth sleep well\\nis to meet their underlying need for  attachment, through either physical or emotional closeness. \\n \\nChildren and youth need to feel that their parents ‘love them no matter what’ (unconditional love). This\\nunconditional love is a powerful way to make sure your relationship with your teen stays strong and close. \\n \\nYou can show your child or teen unconditional love by: \\nAccepting your child for who she is; \\n \\nRespecting his likes and dislikes; \\n \\nSpending lots of time together, taking an interest in her life; \\n \\nSupporting his interests, not pressuring your teen into things you want; \\n \\nNot withdrawing love and attention when your teen messes up. This doesn’t mean that you must\\napprove of everything your teen does. Not everything is OK. You need to convey your love and\\nconcern for your teen as a person, but discuss the behaviour separately.\\nIn the morning \\nStart the day with a warm and aﬀectionate greeting! This helps to start everyone’s day on a positive\\nnote. Kind words, a smile or a hug are nice ways to reconnect ﬁrst thing in the morning. Even with\\ngrumbling teens. Physical contact through a long, deep hug in fact will help make the body make\\noxytocin, a powerful bonding hormone.\\n \\nDo your best to keep the same wakeup time every day (weekends too). The body’s internal\\nclock works best with regular bedtimes and wake up times. When youth don’t get enough sleep\\nduring the week, they often need to catch up on sleep over the weekend. It’s better to aim for\\nearlier bedtimes during the week, so they don’t’ get sleep deprived. \\nYouth can be busy on weeknights with homework, sports, work and other activities. Sometimes they\\nhave too much on their plates. Consider limiting extra activities (perhaps just 1 or 2 activities each\\nsemester). At times when youth are very busy, they may need to get a little extra sleep on the\\nweekend. But try to get them up at a reasonable time, especially on Sunday, so they’ll be able to go\\nto bed at a reasonable time Sunday evening. \\nDuring the daytime', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Sleep in Children and Youth_ Information for Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Throw the ball around outside, play road hockey, take a walk or a\\nyoga class together. Physical activity with your teen is a great way to connect and spend time together.\\nYouth need at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity every day. But timing is important-\\nphysical activity late in the evening can make it more diﬃcult to fall asleep. \\n \\nHealthy meals and snacks. Canada’s food guide will help you plan balanced meals and snacks. For\\nmore information, visit: www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/index-eng.php\\n \\nLimit naps. Some youth are really tired when they get home from school. A short nap can be\\nhelpful, but long naps will interfere with night time sleep. Keep after school naps short-no more than\\n30-60 minutes. \\n \\nBe cautious with stimulants. Is your child having sleep problems since starting ADHD\\nmedications? If so, speak with your child’s doctor.\\n \\nAvoid or limit caﬀeine and energy drinks. While your teen may want to rely on these drinks to\\nstay alert during the day, they can further disrupt sleeping patterns.\\n \\nTalk about stress. Stress or emotional struggles can interfere with sleep. Give your teen a chance\\nto talk with you about what he is feeling and going through. Listen, and validate these feelings. Ask\\nyour teen how she’d like you to support her. Try to avoid jumping in with advice or criticism. Conﬂict\\nbetween family members is common. Reassure youth that you will work through these diﬃculties,\\nand even though you may disagree, you love them no matter what. \\n \\nWork out a reasonable time for bed. You’ll need to sort this out with your teen. It’s much easier\\nto have this kind of discussion if you’ve built up a strong, warm relationship. Spending positive,\\nquality time with youth will help build this kind of relationship. \\nTo talk about sleep, you might start by saying that you’d like to talk about your teen’s sleeping\\nhabits. For example, “It must be tough to get through a long day of school when you’re so tired.”\\nAsk your teen if she would like your advice, or if she would rather that you simply listen. Let your\\nteen know that you’ve learned a few things about getting a good night’s sleep, and oﬀer to share\\nthat information when she’s ready. \\nIf your teen is ready to discuss sleep, together, you can think about when she needs to get up in the\\nmorning, then count back 8 1/2-9 1/2 hours. Suggest that your teen ‘aim’ for this as a weeknight\\nbedtime. Gently encourage at least 9 hours of sleep each night. \\nEvening: helping your teen unwind \\nConnecting before directing. Do everything you can to maintain a warm and positive relationship with\\nyour child or teen. Your child or teen needs to feel important to you, and feel safe talking to you about her\\nfeelings and worries. Sleep problems can come up or get worse if your child or teen doesn’t feel he can turn\\nto you, or if there is a lot of conﬂict between the two of you. Conﬂict can also make it less likely that your\\nteen will accept your suggestions to improve sleep. If you have problems in your relationship with your child\\nor teen that are not improving, consider getting help from a trusted friend, or family member. You may also\\nthink about speaking with a counsellor or therapist. \\n \\nAvoid arguments in the hours before your teen goes to bed. If you have to discuss something\\ndiﬃcult, try to bring it up during the day. Diﬃcult conversations close to bedtime can sometimes lead to\\narguments which make sleep harder-for both of you. \\nGently encourage your teen to: \\nTurn oﬀ all electronics (TV, video games, computers, or any screens that emit light) about 1 hour before\\nbed. It’s best to keep TVs and computers out of bedrooms altogether. Watching TV, movies, playing video\\ngames and connecting with friends on social media stimulate the brain, instead of letting it slow down.

Your teen should associate bed with sleeping. Lying awake in bed is not helpful,\\nand can actually make it more diﬃcult to get to sleep. If your teen can’t get to sleep in about 20 minutes, he\\nshould get up for about 30 minutes and do something non-stimulating. \\nDon’t drink too much liquid close to bedtime. A full bladder before bed means having to get up for a trip to\\nthe bathroom which doesn’t help with sleep.\\nChildren and youth will get better sleep\\nIn the dark.

Fortunately,\\nthere are many simple yet powerful ways to get your sleep back on track.\\nIntroduction\\nIt seems like life is getting more and more stressful all the time, with demands for work, school, family and home\\nresponsibilities. As a result, we often cut back on the very things that are the most important, like getting enough\\nsleep…\\n \\nGetting enough sleep is essential. Studies show that getting enough sleep is essential for maintaining proper\\nhealth. Furthermore, lack of sleep can cause numerous health and related problems. It is a risk factor for mental\\nhealth problems such as depression, and can also contribute to cardiovascular and other conditions. Being sleep\\ndeprived also signiﬁcantly increases your risk of being in a motor vehicle accident.\\n \\nHow much sleep should someone get?  Every person is unique, and there is a wide range of what is considered\\n“normal” sleep. The usual range is that some need as little as 6 hrs, whereas others need 10 or more. The average\\nperson needs about 8 hrs of sleep per night (Kryger, 2005).\\nHow Common is Insomnia and Sleep Problems?\\nInsomnia, or troubles sleeping are quite common: \\n30% of adults report troubles falling asleep, staying asleep or having unrefreshing (nonrestorative) sleep. \\n10% of the population have sleep problems so severe that it causes problems or distress during the\\ndaytime.\\nWhy Do People Have Sleep Problems?\\nWe are seeing an explosion of sleep problems in modern society.\\nOne of the theories is that modern society does not give our brains what we really need for sleep…\\nIn a traditional society In modern society\\nPeople would wake up early, and be active during the day\\n(i.e. hunter, gathering, farming) while getting hours of\\nsunlight outside.Many people spend most of their days indoors (which does\\nnot give enough natural, blue light).', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Sleep Problems.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

When it gets dark at night, people continue to stay up and\\nexpose themselves to screens, which give blue light, which\\ntricks the brain into thinking its still daytime.\\nThere are also other factors that can contribute to sleep problems including:\\nStress: We live in a stressful society, which leads many people to worry at bedtime, either stressing about\\nthe day that just passed, or about the next day.\\nNormal aging: People tend to sleep less and sleep lighter as they grow older. As we age, our ability to sleep\\ndiminishes, but our need for sleep stays the same. Furthermore, as people get older, they tend to need to\\ngo use the washroom in the middle of the night, which an impair sleep.\\nMedical problems: Many diﬀerent medical conditions can aﬀect our sleep, and in particular there are sleep\\ndisorders such as restless legs syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea and others.\\nStrategies for Sleep: \"Stimulus Control” Method\\nThe “Stimulus Control” Method is a simple, yet very powerful technique that has been shown eﬀective for helping\\nwith sleep (Morin, 1987). Because there are only ﬁve steps in this method this is a good basic strategy to start\\nwith.\\n \\nThere are ﬁve steps;\\nGo to bed only when you feel sleepy, no matter how late the hour.1.\\nUse your bed only for sleeping.2.\\nIf you don\\'t fall asleep in 10 to 20 minutes, get up and go to another room.3.\\nUse your alarm clock to get up at the same time every morning, regardless of how little sleep you got the4.\\nnight before.\\nDon\\'t nap during the day.5.\\nDuring the ﬁrst night of the stimulus-control procedure you may need to get out of bed several times or more. You\\nmay not sleep at all, and you may feel tired the next day. At this point you might think that the solution is worse\\nthan the original problem. But keep at it -- by the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th night, sleep deprivation will cause your body to\\nfall asleep more quickly. Most people need about two weeks to undo the negative sleep pattern that they have\\ngotten into.\\nStrategies for Sleep: Routines for Sleep \\nAre you still having troubles with sleep? Here are some more strategies:\\nDo\\'s \\nWhat To Do In the Daytime\\nWake up the same time every day, whether its weekdays or weekends.\\nEat a healthy, nutritious diet. Have regular, consistent mealtimes which helps set your body’s internal clock.\\nSome people ﬁnd it helpful to avoid large meals at night.\\nGet lots of sunlight during the daytime, especially in the mornings ideally by being outside (with sunscreen).\\nDuring daylight hours, get at least an hour outside a day.

Regular, moderate-intensity exercise is known to improve sleep quality. Take a brisk walk, do\\nsome gardening, or join an exercise class. Avoid exercise in the late evening before bedtime because it may\\nover-stimulate the body.\\nDo you live in the northern hemisphere (e.g. Canada)? If so, consider a seasonal aﬀective disorder (SAD)\\nlight during winter months. Sit near it for 30 minutes in the morning before work/school.\\nWhat To Do In the Evening\\nDim and/or limit light in the evening. If you are having sleep problems, the best thing would be to not have\\nany artiﬁcial light or technology in your home. Then, as it gets dark, you are exposed to natural darkness\\nand you’d sleep. (Such as might happen if you went camping…) The next best option is that you can try to\\nturn oﬀ unnecessary lights, and ideally, have dimmers on your lighting. Then, you can simulate the normal\\ndarkness that happens as the sun starts to set.\\nLow blue sunglasses. Consider wearing orange (i.e. low blue light) sunglasses about 1-2 hrs before bedtime,\\nin order to block the blue light that makes it hard to sleep.\\nLow blue light lightbulbs. Use orange / red lightbulbs about 1-2 hrs before bedtime. These can be easily\\npurchased online or in most lighting stores.\\nTurn oﬀ all electronics and stop looking into any electronic screens at least 1-2 hrs before bedtime.\\nDo you absolutely have to use a computer screen in the evening? If so, explore ‘low blue light’ apps\\nsuch as Flux.io for Mac/PC. These apps will change the hue of the computer to a orange/red light, so\\nthe computer will block less of your body’s melatonin.\\nFigure out what activities help your body feel soothed and relaxed, in order to \"wind down\" your body for\\nsleep, so that you can do those as part of your bedtime routine. If you are having sleep problems, then try\\nto give yourself at least 1-hr or so of wind down time.\\nConsistency and routine. Your body’s internal clock likes routines. Have the same, regular bedtime routine\\nevery night. Keep the same routine on weekdays and weekends.\\nHave a regular bedtime routine. It is important to have a regular bedtime routine or ritual that lets you get\\nready for sleep. E.g. Putting on pajamas, brushing your teeth, reading a relaxing book, prayer, etc.\\nWarm bath: Taking a warm bath to relax 1-2 hours before bedtime. In general, people ﬁnd warm baths\\nsoothing, whereas hot, cool or cold baths are stimulating.\\nProblems with worries? If you have too many worries that make it hard to sleep, consider the following:\\nWrite down a TO DO list of things so that you can get things out of your head, and onto paper. \\nSet aside time to think about or deal with whatever those issues are that you are keeping you from\\nbeing able to sleep.

The good news is that there are many strategies that can be used to help one\\nfeel safer, and be able to talk freely with others.\\nIntroduction\\nIt\\'s the adult who has never dated because he\\'s too shy to talk to members of the opposite sex. It\\'s the quiet\\nemployee who is under-appreciated by his co-workers and underpaid by his company. It\\'s that great, funny person\\nthat you know, but who suﬀers from loneliness because s/he is too shy unless around close friends and relatives...\\nDo I have Social Anxiety Disorder?\\nDo you have any of the following?\\nSigniﬁcant and persistent fears of social or performance situations in which embarrassment, rejection, or\\nscrutiny are possible.\\nYou either avoid such situations, or endure them with distress (e.g. having symptoms of anxiety)\\nThe fear is unreasonable and/or causes problems in your life\\nIf you answer positive to any of these screening questions, then read on to learn more... \\nOverview\\nIt is normal for everyone to be shy at certain times. For example, many people would have some nervousness\\nabout doing a big presentation, or about meeting a new boss for the ﬁrst time. Having \"just enough\" shyness is\\ngood because it helps prevent people from doing things that might get them embarrassed or into trouble. But if\\nyou are feeling so shy that it causes you problems at school, work or relationships, then it may be social anxiety\\ndisorder...\\n \\nSocial anxiety (aka social phobia, or social anxiety disorder) is a condition where people get extremely anxious in\\nsocial situations (especially around new people or situations) and tend to worry about what other people think\\nabout them, e.g. worrying they will do something and be humiliated or embarrassed. The anxiety is so severe that\\nit paralyzes people, leading them to avoid and withdraw from social situations. Deep down, they would like to be\\nable to be with and easily talk with other people, if only the anxiety didn\\'t get in the way.

       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 5\\nWhat Causes Social Anxiety?\\nHuman beings have an alarm system hard-wired into us. This alarm system helped us survive as hunter-gatherers.\\nFor example, when faced with a danger, such as being attacked by a sabre tooth tiger, our alarm system would\\nactivate (via a rush of adrenaline), which would then allow us to either \"ﬁght\" the danger, or take \"ﬂight\" (and run\\naway).\\nWe no longer live as hunter-gatherers, but rather in modern society. Fortunately, most of us no longer face the\\nsame physical dangers that we used to face, we continue to have various stresses and \"dangers\" in modern\\nsociety. Our stresses and \"dangers\" include social expectations, ﬁtting in with others, getting along with other\\npeople, as well people that may range from being not so nice, to outright mean and bullying. \\nIn social anxiety, the person\\'s alarm system is overly sensitive, and becomes triggered by social situations. Why is\\nthat person\\'s alarm system overly sensitive? A combination of diﬀerent factors that can contribute to one\\'s social\\nanxiety such as:\\nGenetics: Some people are simply wired to be more sensitive, and this \"hard wiring\" can be passed through\\nthe genes from parents to their children. It is actually good to be sensitive, especially in a world of\\ninsensitivity, however the key is balance. With social anxiety, the sensitivity is excessive. \\nLife experiences: In the ideal world, we would all have experiences where you have experienced other\\npeople as being nice and accepting. In people with social anxiety, they may have had stressful social\\nsituations, such as teasing, bullying or other stressful social interactions, with teacher(s), family member(s)\\nor others. \\nHow Common is it?\\nPeople with social phobia have usually been shy all their life, but it becomes more noticeable around the teenage\\nyears, as social stresses increase.\\n \\nIt aﬀects people of all ages, and it is believed that 8% of Canadians have had symptoms of it at some point in their\\nlives (Stats Can, 2002).\\nSigns and Symptoms of Social Anxiety\\nPeople with social anxiety may notice the following before and/or during social situations: \\nBlushing, sweating, feeling hot\\nNausea\\nTrembling, shaking\\nDiﬃculty talking or making eye contact\\nTypes of Social Anxiety\\nAccording to the DSM (a manual of mental health conditions used by professionals), there are two main types of\\nsocial anxiety disorder:\\n1. Generalized Tend to avoid (or endure with distress) a wide variety of social situations: starting\\nup conversation with others (who aren\\'t close friends); talking to strangers; talking\\non the phone; expressing personal opinions; talking to those in authority (e.g.,\\nteacher, employer).\\n2. Non-generalized  (aka\\n\"Performance Anxiety\") Diﬃculties mainly in performance situations, such as public speaking, talking in\\nclasses or meetings; performing music or acting on stage; eating or drinking in\\nfront of others. \\n \\nIf You Suspect Social Anxiety Disorder', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Social Anxiety Disorder in Adults.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Your\\nhealth professional can help make sure that there are no medical conditions contributing to the anxiety, such as\\nhormone problems. Your doctor can then help with any referrals to more specialized mental health services or\\nprofessionals in the community, such as a psychologist.\\nIt\\'s Important to Get Help\\nWhen left untreated or ignored, people with untreated social anxiety report a lower quality of life, including a\\nhigher risk of being either unemployed, or being paid less if they are employed. In the long run, untreated social\\nanxiety may contribute to other problems such as depression and substance abuse.\\nHow Is It Treated?\\nThe good news is that there are many eﬀective treatments for social anxiety.  \\n1. Counseling/therapy  \\nProfessionals such as occupational therapists (OT), social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists can help people\\novercome social anxiety through a variety of techniques. \\nTechniques include:\\nSelf-regulation One starts with identifying when one is calm (\"in the green zone\"), versus getting stressed\\n(\"in the yellow\"), and getting overwhelmed in ﬁght/ﬂight (\"in the red zone\"). \\nOne can then learn diﬀerent strategies to use in order to feel calmer, which can diﬀer\\ndepending on the zone.\\nWhen in the green zone, we can talk about our problems to problem-solve them. \\nWhen in the yellow zone, we may be getting stressed out and don\\'t want to problem-solve;\\nwe may need people to just listen to us and empathize with how we are feeling. We may not\\nwant people to tell us to do deep breathing, or tell us to relax.\\nWhen in the red zone, we may be so stressed out, that we might just want someone to sit\\nwith us and not say anything; or give us space (and check in with us a few minutes later); and\\nwe usually want things to be quieter, with less sensory stimulation (such as less people\\naround, less sound).  \\nChanging worry\\nthoughts into more\\nhelping thoughtsCommon fears in social anxiety include:\\n• Fears about other people: \"Everyone\\'s going to laugh\", \"They\\'re all watching me\"\\n• Fears about oneself: \"I\\'m going to make a fool of myself\", \"I\\'ll be humiliated\".\\nReplace those thoughts with more helpful thoughts such as:\\n• \"Nobody\\'s going to laugh, and even if they did, so what? They\\'ll forget it by the next day\\nanyways!\" \"They are not all watching me - its not like I\\'m some big celebrity or something!\"\\n• \"I\\'m not going to make a fool of myself - after all, what I\\'m going to do isn\\'t half as bad as\\nwhat everyone else has done so far!\" \"I\\'m not going to be humiliated - I\\'ve survived worse!\"\\nExposure Exposure is gradually and repeatedly exposing the person to the feared situation, until the\\nperson is no longer afraid of the situation. When faced with a challenging situation, exposure\\nis about breaking the challenging situation into smaller less challenging situations, and doing\\nit step-by-step, and ﬁghting the natural impulse to completely avoid.\\nFor example, someone who is afraid to talk to teachers might do it step-by-step such as:\\n• With a teacher, privately, alone after (or before class)\\n    ⚬ Writing a note on paper or electronically (such as using a text-to-speech app, or just\\ntyping the text), and sharing it with the teacher;\\n    ⚬ Talking to the teacher\\n• With a teacher and others around\\n    ⚬ Communicating to the teacher, with a pre-arranged set of common requests, such as,\\n\"Can I have a break?\" \"I don\\'t understand, can you explain that again...?\"\\nRole plays Role plays are where one practices new ways of responding to situations that are scary. For\\nexample, imagine an adult who is anxious about what to say when meeting new people. One\\nmight practice that situation with a therapist (or a friend or family member), or even just\\ntalking in front of a mirror.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Social Anxiety Disorder in Adults.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 4 / 5\\nSocial skills training This is here a person is explicitly taught the steps and rules of eﬀective social interaction.\\nLearning about social skills is something that we expect most people to simply learn, or pick\\nup on their own. At school, most people don\\'t get any \"course\" on how to talk to others, how\\nto make friends, or other key life skills. But because people with social anxiety tend to avoid\\nsocial situations, they end up having fewer chances to learn social skills. Thus, it can be\\nhelpful to provide direct teaching about social and interpersonal skills.\\nProblem-solving: Working together with the person to ﬁgure out what problems are causing stress and then\\ndeal with them. The person is taught how to solve problems systematically by brainstorming,\\nestimating the advantages and disadvantages of various possible solutions to a problem, and\\nplanning the steps involved in implementing the best solution. It is important for the person\\nto learn how to go through this process whenever he or she faces a problem, not simply to\\nlearn how to solve one immediate problem.\\nSocial anxiety tends to trick people into avoiding problems (and situations), and so one of the\\nkey strategies in cognitive behaviour therapy (or any therapy, for that matter) is to simply\\nhelp people to gradually face their problems (and situations) gradually more and more.\\n2. Medications\\nHas the person tried counseling/therapy and other strategies without success? Or is the anxiety so severe the\\ntalking to a professional has not been possible?

The\\ndoctor can then help with any referrals to more specialized mental health services or professionals in the\\ncommunity, such as a psychologist.\\nHow Is It Treated?\\nTypical treatments for social anxiety include:\\n \\n1. Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) , which helps people overcome social anxiety through a variety of\\ncognitive and behavioural techniques.  Techniques used in CBT include:\\n \\na. Cognitive restructuring : learning to think in a diﬀerent and more positive way about other people and about\\noneself. Many people with social anxiety feel that they are not good at anything and that they will always fail,\\nso there is no point in trying.\\n \\nb. Exposure : gradually and repeatedly exposing the person to the feared situation, until the person is no\\nlonger afraid of the situation. For example, someone who is afraid to talk to teachers might start by talking to\\nthe teacher after class, privately, and then work up to being able to talk to the teacher during class with\\nothers around. Exposure is done using a ‘hierarchy\\', a step-by-step approach starting with easy behaviours\\nand working up to more challenging behaviours.\\n \\nc. Role plays : where a person practices new ways of responding to situations that are scary. For example, a\\nchild who is anxious about talking to other children might practice a pretend situation with a family member\\nor therapist.\\n \\nd. Social skills training : where a person is explicitly taught the steps and rules of eﬀective social interaction.\\nBecause individuals with social anxiety avoid social situations, they often do not have the same opportunities\\nto learn social skills as others might have. Thus, it may be helpful to explicitly learn what to do.\\n \\ne. Problem-solving : working together with the child to ﬁgure out what problems are getting in the way of the\\nchild. The individual is taught how to solve problems systematically by brainstorming, estimating the\\nadvantages and disadvantages of various possible solutions to a problem, and planning the steps involved in\\nimplementing the best solution. It is important for the child to learn how to go through this process whenever\\nhe or she faces a problem, not simply to learn how to solve one immediate problem.\\n \\n2. Medications, which can be prescribed by a physician.

Evidence shows that when appropriately used, medication is safe and eﬀective\\n(Bridge, JAMA, Apr 18, 2007).

Don\\'t blame yourself, or your child/youth for the social anxiety problems. It simply isn\\'t\\nhelpful. And frankly, there are so many diﬀerent factors for social anxiety, including genetics, and the\\nenvironment that it is never any single person\\'s fault. Instead, focus your energy on asking, \"What can I do\\nright now to help my child?\"\\n \\nAllow your child to face his/her fears; don\\'t be overprotective. It is natural to try to protect your shy,\\nanxious child from stressful social interactions. But when your child is overprotected, it makes things worse\\nbecause your child misses out on opportunities to pick up the skills needed to make friends.  Parents can\\ngently encourage social contacts.  For a young child, it may be helpful to arrange joint activities with other', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Social Anxiety in Children and Youth_ Information for Parents and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

However, it may not be wise to set children up to \"sink or swim\" -\\nto force them all at once into too many activities or activities they ﬁnd extremely stressful. Helping your\\nchild gradually face his/her fears by starting with less challenging, and gradually move up to more\\nchallenging social situations. For example, start with closely supervised, structured activities. E.g. watching\\na movie. If successful, then move to less supervised, more unstructured activities. E.g. playing an imaginary\\ngame together with a friend.\\nSeeing that the anxious child is unable to plan and manage social contacts, many parents start to direct and\\ncontrol their anxious children\\'s social lives completely.  This can be overdone, depriving the child even\\nfurther of the opportunity to learn how to manage things.  It is often more helpful to provide gentle guidance\\nand to ask pointed questions that help the shy, anxious child learn to plan and solve problems.\\n \\nIf at ﬁrst, you don\\'t succeed... Children with anxiety tend to cope by avoidance, which means they tend\\nto avoid challenges and stresses. If a child is not yet successful in a situation, adults can talk to the child\\nabout what made the situation diﬃcult, try to problem-solve it, and then most importantly, try again.\\nParents can express sympathy and understanding and give hope by emphasizing there will be more chances\\nin the future to succeed ...\\n \\nAllow your child to express and feel whatever s/he feels. It is also natural for parents to try to change\\ntheir children\\'s expressions of anxiety and sadness, e.g. by saying, \"Don\\'t be sad - that\\'s nothing to feel sad\\nabout!\" This invalidates the child and leads the child to keep those feelings inside.

But when you feel so anxious\\nthat it’s hard to go out and take part in everyday activities, you might have social anxiety\\ndisorder (sometimes called “Social Phobia”). The good news is that there is a lot you can do to\\nhandle anxiety and to reduce it.\\nWhat is Social Anxiety Disorder?\\nMany people feel shy or stressed in social situations. But when you feel so anxious that it’s hard to go out and take\\npart in everyday activities, you might have social anxiety disorder (sometimes called “Social Phobia”). People with\\nsocial anxiety can become very fearful about things like: \\nMeeting new people; \\nGoing somewhere new; \\nSpeaking in public; \\nEating or drinking in front of others; \\nMaking phone calls; \\nGoing to school or work; \\nGoing shopping; \\nTaking the bus. \\nMany people with social anxiety disorder will avoid these activities altogether, because they cause such anxiety.\\nAvoiding can be a problem, because it can interfere with having friends, going to school, or just doing the things\\nthat every person needs to do. It can be isolating, and stop us from doing some really fun and cool things. \\nHow Common is Social Anxiety?\\nSocial anxiety is quite common. 1 out of 20 youth have this disorder.  It tends to increase with age. \\nUnderstanding Social Anxiety \\nSo, social anxiety is being worried about or fearful of social situations, to the point where you may start avoiding\\nthese situations. As humans, we’ve evolved to avoid or run from the things that scare us. This was really helpful\\nwhen we lived close to animals that wanted to eat us for dinner. Our body’s fear response helped us to run away\\nby increasing our heart rate and breathing. We experience these same feelings when we’re afraid today, even', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Social Anxiety_ Youth Edition.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 5\\nthough our lives are rarely in danger. \\n \\nHow does anxiety aﬀect me?\\n \\nAnxiety aﬀects our bodies, thoughts, feelings and behaviours. Gaining back control when we are anxious can be\\nchallenging, but it is possible. The ﬁrst step is to become more aware of how anxiety aﬀects us. Below are just a\\nfew examples of how anxiety can aﬀect us. \\n \\nAnxiety can cause your thoughts to be: \\nNegative; \\nRepetitive; \\nDistracted; \\nNarrowly focussed; \\nCritical; \\nConfused. \\nIn your body, anxiety can cause: \\nRacing heart; \\nRapid breathing (and hyperventilation); \\nShaking hands, shaky voice; \\nDry mouth; \\n‘Butterﬂies’ in your stomach, nausea; \\nSweating; \\nRed blotches on your skin; \\nHeadache, stomach ache or other pain. \\nAnxiety can make you feel: \\nNervous; \\nSad, moody; \\nGuilty; \\nHumiliated; \\nPanicked \\nIrritable; \\nAngry; \\nEmbarrassed.\\nAnxiety can cause you to: \\nEat more or less than usual; \\nAvoid certain people or situations; \\nProcrastinate (put things oﬀ until later); \\nSelf medicate with alcohol or drugs; \\nSleep more or less than usual. \\nWhat Causes Social Anxiety Disorder?\\nThere are a few things that contribute to social anxiety disorder. The amount each ‘factor’ contributes is diﬀerent\\nfor each person. \\n \\n1. Genetics or Family: Some of us are born with a tendency to be more shy or anxious. Also, if other family\\nmembers have challenges with anxiety, you are also more likely to have social anxiety disorder. This might be due\\nto the genes your parents gave you or because of some behaviours you might have learned while growing up. \\n ', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Social Anxiety_ Youth Edition.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Page 3 / 5\\n2. Life experiences: You might be more shy or fearful in social situations if you’ve had a really bad experience in\\nthe past, like being bullied, teased, embarrassed or rejected. This could make you worry about this happening\\nagain. Or maybe you haven’t had much of a chance to learn how to handle some social situations. If you don’t feel\\nconﬁdent in your ability to cope with a situation, you can become anxious. \\nHow Can I Cope with my Anxious Feelings?\\nThe good news is that there is a lot you can do to handle anxiety and to reduce it! \\nCheck the facts\\nOften we can become anxious because we make a false assumptions about a situation or don't know all the\\nfacts. For example, we might become anxious and think our friend hates us because he or she hasn’t been\\nable to hang out lately. We might be able to check the facts and see that our friend has been extremely\\nbusy with exams or just hasn't felt like going out. Knowing this might help reduce your anxiety. \\n \\nWhenever you notice your stress level going up, check the facts. Take a step back and ask yourself “What\\nbad or scary thing do I think is going to happen? How likely is it that it will happen?” Most of the time, it’s\\nreally unlikely that your worst fear will happen. Do your best to let your worried thoughts go.\\nOpposite Action \\n‘Opposite action’ is something you can do when you know you’re avoiding something. Acting a certain way\\ncan actually help you feel diﬀerently about things-though it takes practice. If you avoid social situations\\nbecause you are afraid, your anxiety will likely increase. If you face your fears and do the “opposite action”\\nyour anxiety will likely decrease as you see the situation may not be as bad as you ﬁrst imagined. \\nBuild Mastery \\nMastery means getting good at stuﬀ. It’s really important to have various types of success: at school,work,\\nwith friends, or in other things important to you. Building mastery allows us to feel good about ourselves\\nand gives us a sense of control (which we may not have if we are living with social anxiety disorder). \\n \\nYou can start by planning activities that will help you to build a sense ofaccomplishment, no matter how big\\nor small. Try to challenge yourself by trying something that is diﬃcult yet possible. It’s OK if things don’t\\nwork out at ﬁrst-keep trying. If things still don’t work out, try something a little easier, then go back to tackle\\nthe bigger challenge. \\n \\nTry:\\nLearning a subject inside out; \\nPracticing a sport; \\nLearn to create art; \\nPlay an instrument.\\nRelax \\nPut relaxation on your daily schedule. It helps lower tension and helps the body rest. This means doing at\\nleast one activity that is stress free and brings pleasure (like reading, sports, crafts, or music). \\nIndulge your 5 senses \\nTreat all 5 of your senses: seeing, hearing, smelling, tastinge and touching. Surround yourself with\\nwonderful sights, great sounds or music, fantastic smells, delicious food and comfort from a warm blanket,\\nhoodie or bath. \\nDistract yourself \\nSometimes experiences can be overwhelming. When this happens, it can help to distract yourself from the\\nsituation that is making you anxious. \\n \", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Social Anxiety_ Youth Edition.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 4 / 5\\nTry:\\n‘Fidget tools’ like stress balls, an elastic or pencil; \\nDistraction games, like ‘I spy’; \\nTaking a deep breath, and carefully take note of everything you see. Go over the dozens (or\\nhundreds!) of things you notice, saying its name to yourself and its size, shape and colour. Keep\\ntaking a slow, deep breath in between each thing you name. Keep going until you notice your anxiety\\nsubside.\\nWhen to See a Professional\\nIf your anxiety is getting in the way of things, is getting too hard to handle, or interferes with having friends or\\ndaily activities, then you might want to tell your doctor, or some other professional. \\nWhat Types of Treatment Are There for Social Anxiety?\\n1. Therapy or counselling \\n \\nSocial anxiety is often treated with Cognitive (thinking) Behavioural Therapy (CBT). This ‘talk therapy’ can be really\\neﬀective. This type of counselling can help you to: \\nLearn to think in more positive ways, which gradually changes the way you feel about things; \\nGradually get more comfortable in situations that are diﬃcult for you; \\nLearn and practice skills that will help you in social situations; \\n• Solve problems. \\n2. Medication \\n \\nIn more severe cases of social anxiety, a combination of medication and talk therapy is often very helpful. \\n \\nMedication helps reduce the impact of your anxiety and makes it easier for you to practice the skills you’re\\nlearning. Medications are typically considered when: \\nCounselling or therapy alone are not helping; \\nThe anxiety is so severe that counselling is not possible. \\n3. Take care of yourself\\nGet enough sleep. Get into a sleep routine-you need about 8-9 hours each night. Keep distracting things\\nout of your room when you’re trying to fall asleep. \\nEat well. Do your best to eat lots of fruit and veggies. \\nExercise. You need about an hour a day of physical activity, and it’s best to exercise outside in the sun.\\nAerobic exercise (exercise that increases the heart rate and breathing) can have an anti-depressant eﬀect. \\nAvoid caﬀeine (or cut down as much as you can). \\nAuthors\\nReviewed by the Mental Health Information Committee at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO).\\nThanks to YouthNet’s Youth Advisory Committee (YAC-CHEO) for reviewing and providing feedback to this fact\\nsheet! \\nLicense\\nUnder a Creative Commons License.

Having \\'just enough\\' stress actually helps us function, but having \\'too much\\' stress is\\nbad for emotional and physical health. The good news is that there are many things that can be\\ndone to identify and cope better with stress...\\n(Original title \"Learn About... Stress\", from the Canadian Mental Health Association, BC Division)\\nIntroduction\\nYou have a major deadline coming up tomorrow and you still have a ton of work to do. Your child’s principal called;\\nyour child is being disruptive…again. You have 12 people coming over for dinner this weekend and you still have\\nno idea what you’re going to make. On top of everything else, your mother isn’t feeling well but refuses to go to\\nthe doctor. Your muscles are feeling tense, you ﬁnd yourself nervously tapping your feet as you sit at your desk.\\nYour thoughts keep racing around in your head and the people around you are starting to avoid you because you\\nkeep snapping at them. This is stress. And most of us have been there.\\nWhat is it?\\nStress is the response of your body and mind to demands being placed on you. When you feel threatened, your\\nbrain releases chemicals called hormones that send alarm signals throughout your body. These hormones prepare\\nyour body to take action. The hormones make your skin sweat, your breathing quicken, your heart rate go up, your\\nmuscles tense, and your senses come alive. It\\'s this \"ﬁght or ﬂight\" stress response that allowed our human\\nancestors to survive when face to face with a threat. Unfortunately, most of our modern \"threats\" like workloads or\\nfamily conﬂict are not situations we can easily ﬁght with our ﬁsts or run away from. When we don’t have a healthy\\nway to deal with stress, it can harm us more than help.\\n \\nSome common sources of stress, known as stressors, include the following:\\nPhysical environments – around you can raise your stress level. Traﬃc, noise (sirens keeping you up at\\nnight, a barking dog next door), and uncomfortable or unsafe living conditions can also cause stress. People\\nwho have lived through wars or natural disasters know too well the devastating impact that their\\nenvironment can have on their well-being.\\nFamily and relationships – are common daily stressors. Marital disagreements, unhealthy relationships,\\nrebellious teens, or caring for an ill family member or a child with special needs can all send stress levels\\nskyrocketing.\\nWork – can be an ever-present source of stress. Work stress is caused by things such as job dissatisfaction,\\nan exhausting workload, insuﬃcient pay, oﬃce politics, and conﬂicts with your boss or co-workers. ', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Stress.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Page 2 / 3\\nLife situations – can cause stress. For example, poverty, ﬁnancial pressures, discrimination or harassment,\\nunemployment, isolation, and/or a lack of social support all take a toll on your daily quality of life.\\nMajor life changes — such as the birth of a baby, a divorce, a career change or move can also place a lot of\\nstress on you—even if the event itself is positive.\\nIn small amounts, stress is actually good for us. Stress can motivate us and push us to reach our potential. It’s\\nstress that helps you get through that presentation to your clients or forces us to do homework when we’d rather\\ntake a nap. Stress is very individual. What you ﬁnd stressful may not be stressful for someone else.\\n \\nIt’s important to know that stress in itself is not a mental illness. But when the stress keeps piling up and it starts\\nto make you feel worse instead of motivating you, it can harm your mental health and well-being. Stress is a risk\\nfactor for someone who is already vulnerable to developing a mental illness. Stress can aﬀect us physically too. In\\nhigh amounts stress can, for example, cause high blood pressure and make it hard for your body to ﬁght oﬀ\\ninfections.\\nWho does it aﬀect?\\nStress aﬀects most of us. In a recent international poll, three-quarters of Canadians said they experienced stress in\\ntheir daily lives either frequently or fairly often . But stress can aﬀect some people diﬀerently than others:\\nWomen – are more likely than men to report feeling stressed. Men and women also report reacting to\\ndiﬀerent kinds of stress. Women tend to react more to chronic stressors like time constraints, meeting\\nothers' expectations, marital relationships, children, and family health. Men, on the other hand, are more\\naﬀected by work-related stressors like a change in job, demotion, pay cut, and ﬁnancial diﬃculties.\\nYouth – are doing more today than ever before, balancing school with other activities, friends and jobs. All of\\nthese responsibilities can lead to stress. In one survey, one in 10 teens reported regularly feeling very\\nstressed with not having enough time in the day.\\nOlder adults – face stressors like major illness, changes in routine and income related to retirement, physical\\nchanges, the death of a spouse and a shrinking circle of friends. All of these stressors can contribute to\\nincreased levels of stress in Canada’s elderly.\\nPeople with chronic illnesses – like diabetes, arthritis or heart disease can experience extreme stress\\nbecause they worry about their illness, their treatments and the eﬀect that the illness will have on\\nthemselves and those around them.\\nWhat can I do about it?\\nBecause stress is so individual, we each need to ﬁnd our own way to cope. There are some things that you can do\\nto ﬁgure out how to best deal with your stress:\\nFind out what stresses you the most: If you need to, make a list of everything that’s on your mind. You can’t\\ndo anything to stop your stress until you know what causes it.\\nProblem solve: Deal with problems eﬀectively. Life problems, like ﬁnancial issues, family conﬂicts or\\nproblems at work can be a huge cause of stress. Learning to deal with problems properly can make a big\\ndiﬀerence. There are a number of steps to problem solving:\\nIdentify the problem\\nSet some goals\\nMake a list of possible solutions\\nChoose a solution from your list\\nPut your solution into action\\nTrack your progress\\nDon’t procrastinate: Don’t put oﬀ the things you need to do. Keeping a daily planner can help keep you\\norganized and on track. Focus on tasks as well as decisions. Putting oﬀ making decisions can cause\\nunnecessary stress and worry.\\nTalk about it: Sometimes we just need to vent. Talk to someone you can trust. If your school, workplace or\\nfaith community oﬀers counseling, take advantage of it.\\nShare your work load: Delegate your responsibilities.

This applies at home too: ask family and friends for help.\\nSelf-care: Exercise, meditation or prayer, getting a good night’s sleep, eating well, petting your dog or cat,\\ngoing for a walk, laughing and stretching—all of these are great stress relievers. Unfortunately, they are also\\nsometimes the ﬁrst things we stop doing when we feel under pressure.\\nJust say no: You can’t please everybody.

The good\\nnews is that there are many things that caregivers can do to support their children and youth\\nthinking about suicide. This includes getting professional help, as well as listening, accepting\\nand validating how your loved one feels, as well as coming up with a plan to reconnect them to\\npeople and activities that bring purpose, belonging, hope and meaning.\\nWhat is Suicide?\\nSuicide is the act of ending one\\'s life. It is unfortunate, but modern society tends to be stressful and disconnecting,\\nand as a result, some children and youth may think about ending their lives. People may suicidal when they feel\\ndisconnected from people or activities that give a sense of belonging, purpose, hope and meaning. \\nStresses can contribute, such as:\\nSchool stress such as problems with friends, schoolwork, teachers, bullies.\\nHome stress, such as conﬂict or disagreements with family members.\\nWork stresses such as problems with co-workers, bosses, workload.\\nModern society, with the way that screens, technology and other factors tend to disconnect people from\\nhuman connection, sleep and other essentials;\\nOther problems such as depression, anxiety, substance use.\\nThe good news is that there are many ways to help young people who are feeling suicidal, by helping them\\nreconnect to people and activities that give belonging, purpose, hope and meaning. \\nWarning Signs for Suicide\\nThe following is a list of signs that may indicate someone is thinking about suicide. Its normal for many people to\\nhave one or two of these signs from time to time, but having many of these would be a reason to seek help: \\nYour child expresses feelings of worthlessness, such as, \"I\\'m no good to anybody.\"\\nYour child talks about suicide and about what it would be like if things end such as \"When I\\'m gone ...\" or\\nask questions such as, \"What would it be like if I wasn\\'t around?\"\\nYour child becomes preoccupied with giving away or distributing his/her possessions.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Suicidal Thoughts in Children and Youth_ Guide for Parents.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

How have you been\\nfeeling these days?”\\nDo ask about suicide if you are concerned. You might say:\\n“Does it ever get so bad life doesn’t feel worth living?”\\n“Would you ever do anything to end your life?”\\n“Would you be able to tell us if you feel like doing something?”\\nDo stay calm and be soothing (as opposed to getting upset and scared).\\nDo ask your loved one how you can support them. \\n\"I\\'m here. How can I support you?\"\\nIf your loved one says \"I don\\'t know\", then give them options, e.g. 1) listening; 2) simply being with\\nthem; 3) distracting them with an activity, 4) giving them space and checking in later, etc. \\nDoes your loved one want to talk?\\nEmotional support: “Do you want to talk? I’m here to listen.”\\nDo listen longer than usual while your loved one is talking, without interrupting.\\nDon’t jump in\\nValidate and accept that your loved one is struggling: “Thank you for letting me know that you’ve\\nbeen feeling this way.”\\nDo empathize, e.g. “Yes, I can appreciate that would be diﬃcult.”\\nDo empathize your connection and give hope: “You’re not alone. I’m here with you. We’ll get through\\nthis together.”\\nDo ask before giving advice.\\nAsk: “Would you like some advice?”\\nIf your child says no, then don’t give unwanted advice. You may be tempted to want to give advice,\\ne.g. “You should eat better and get more exercise”, but if your child is not ready for advice, it is\\nbetter to wait until they are ready as opposed to giving unwanted advice.\\nDo give other options if your loved one doesn’t want to talk\\n“Thanks for letting me know you don’t want to talk about it right now. How can I support you?”\\nDistraction: “Do you want to go for a walk? Watch a show? Bake some cookies?” etc.\\nPhysical comfort: “Can I give you a hug? Want a blanket?”\\nDo respect that many times, children and youth want space.\\n“Thanks for letting me know you want some space. I’ll check on you in a bit. I’m here when you need\\nme.”\\nDo ask about possible stressors that might be contributing.\\nPeople often think about suicide when they are overwhelmed by stress, such as stresses at school,\\nhome or relationships. You might say:\\n\"Everyone has stress, or things that bug them. Like things at school, or home. What stresses that\\nyour dealing with?\"\\nDo talk about possible ways to address stresses at home, school, when your child is open to it.\\nDon’ts\\nDon\\'t say things such as \"You shouldn\\'t be feeling this way\" or \"You should count yourself lucky\" or “you', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Suicidal Thoughts in Children and Youth_ Guide for Parents.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Don\\'t say things such as... \"How can you possibly feel this way? After all that we\\'ve done for you?\\nIs this the way you repay us? How can you do this to us?\" Such blame will most likely make your child feel\\nworse, making it less likely that s/he will conﬁde in you. And worse, in some cases such statements will only\\nconﬁrm to the child that s/he is a burden, increasing the risk of suicide.\\nDon\\'t be afraid to ask. Asking does not make people suicidal.\\nDon’t belittle or minimize their concerns\\nDon\\'t try to make your loved one feel guilty, or make it about you\\nE.g. Don’t say, “How can you feel suicidal with everything we’ve done for you?”\\nE.g. Don’t say “I don’t understand how you can feel this way -- life was so much harder when I was a\\nchild”\\nProviding a Safe Home for a Person Feeling Suicidal\\nWhenever someone has thoughts about suicide, whether those thoughts are active or not, make your home a safer\\nplace by removing potential sources of harm:\\n \\n1. Remove ﬁrearms and weapons\\nMake sure that there are no ﬁrearms, ammunition or weapons in the home. Remove any ﬁrearms from the\\nhome by giving to a trusted friend/neighbour, or by taking them to the local police station if no other options\\ncan be found.\\n2. Remove alcohol\\nSince alcohol aﬀects rational thinking and lowers inhibitions, alcohol can be a risk factor for suicide. Hence,\\nremove alcohol from the home or keep in small amounts only.\\n3. Medications\\nPrescription medications should be locked up. People who are depressed often overdose on the very\\nmedications that they are prescribed for depression. Fortunately, in general, newer medications prescribed\\nfor depression (such as Fluoxetine/ProzacTM Fluvoxamine/LuvxTM, Sertraline/ZoloftTM, Paroxetine/PaxilTM,\\nCitalopram/CelexaTM) are signiﬁcantly safer than the older medications, even in overdose. Nonetheless, it is\\nstill best to lock them up anyways. This includes medications prescribed for other family members.\\nMake sure that when prescriptions are ﬁlled, that you have safe amounts of medication on hand, which\\nmakes it harder to overdose. Ask the physician or pharmacist to dispense safe amounts.\\nSupervise your child when s/he takes medication(s).\\nDispose of all unused or out-of-date medications, by taking them to the local pharmacy for disposal.\\nLock up or get rid of over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen (TylenolTM), acetylsalicylic acid\\n(AspirinTM, or ASA). These medications can be dangerous in overdose, so it is safest to remove them from\\nthe home.\\n4. Remove any other means of suicide\\nRemove or lock up cords, ropes, sharp knives, or other obvious means of self-harm.\\n5. Car keys\\nRemove access to car keys as a car can be used to harm oneself.\\n6. Lock things in the car\\nIf you don\\'t have other options to lock up things, then ﬁrearms or medications can be locked in a car\\n(preferably in the trunk).\\n7.

The good news, is that there are always alternatives and ways to\\ncope.\\nThree key things to remember:\\n1. Suicide is permanent, while our pain and struggles are temporary.\\n2. Help is out there, and it is only a text or a phone call away...\\n3. You are not alone!\\nMany youth will have thoughts of suicide. These thoughts can range from simply wishing for the pain to end, all the\\nway to taking steps to seriously harming themselves. People who have thoughts of suicide often struggle with\\ndistress for a long time. They consider death as one option for stopping their pain. Others might have a sudden\\nurge when they live a moment they ﬁnd diﬃcult to accept. \\n \\nWhen we asked youth about suicide:\\n \\nGuys told us...\\n1 out of every 7 or 8 guys said they had thoughts of suicide in the past;\\nAbout 1 in every 15 guys said they had current thoughts of suicide;\\nabout 1 in every 14 guys said they had attempted suicide (YouthNet Ottawa, 2010) \\nGirls told us us...\\nClose to 1 out of 3 girls said they had thoughts of suicide in the in the past;\\n1 out of every 7 or 8 girls said they had current thoughts of suicide;\\nA little more than 1 in 6 girls said they had attempted suicide (YouthNet, 2010) \\nAlthough young women are twice as likely as young men to attempt suicide, young men are 3 times as likely to die\\nbecause of suicide. This is scary stuﬀ, and needs to change. \\n7 Ways to manage thoughts of suicide\\nThere are many things you can do to handle these thoughts. It might be hard to imagine now, but things really can\\nget better.\\n \\n1. Breathe', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Suicide_ Information for Youth.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 4\\n \\nThis ﬁrst step is often underestimated but very important. If you are having thoughts of suicide, slow down what\\nyou are doing and thinking by taking slow, deep breaths. \\n \\n2. Reach out\\nThere are many ways others can support you. Telling a family member or friend what you are going through can\\nhelp relieve some pressure. Knowing what type of help to ask for will make things easier. Think about people in\\nyour life who can:\\nJust spend time with you, to help distract you and keep you busy (like just hanging out, going to a movie or\\nfor a walk).\\nHelp out with practical things like meals, laundry or going with you to the doctor.\\nListen as you share your feelings and give you emotional support.\\nWhat makes a good listener?\\nGood listeners listen to your feelings without judging, criticizing, or giving unwanted advice. Don’t be afraid\\nto tell a parent, family member or friend the best way to support you.\\nYou might say: \\n“Can we talk? I’m going through a really tough time...\"\\n\"For now, I just need tyou to listen... I don\\'t need advice. I\\'ll let you know if I do... Right now, I just\\nwant someone that I can talk to...\"\\n\"I might get sad and cry... You don\\'t have to do anything... Just listen, hold me, etc.\"\\n\"Just accept me without judging me... No one\\'s been through exactly what I\\'ve been through...\"\\nThink about people in your life who can support you...\\nSomeone to spend time with to take my mind oﬀ things ________________\\nSomeone who can help with practical things __________________________\\nSomeone who is a good listener __________________________\\nIf speaking with someone face to face is hard, you could try:\\nWriting a note\\nE-mail\\nInstant messaging\\nTexting\\n3. Get help\\n \\nIf you have a hard time sharing your thoughts with someone you know, think about others with experience helping\\npeople with thoughts of suicide, like:\\nYour family doctor;\\nWalk-in clinics;\\nTelephone support lines;\\nWebsites that oﬀer online support (see the resource section for more detailed information).\\n4. Stay Safe\\n \\nIf thoughts and urges about suicide grow stronger, you can keep yourself safe by:\\nSurrounding yourself with people you care about;\\nAsking others to remove anything that could be harmful, or might tempt you in a diﬃcult moment;\\nNot using drugs or alcohol;\\nTaking medications only as presecribed by your doctor;\\nCalling a crisis line. They can give you non-judgemental support, and help you make a safety plan if you\\nhave diﬃculty staying safe (see the Emergency Action Plan on page 4 for phone numbers).

       " Document(page_content='Page 3 / 4\\n5. Distract yourself\\n \\nWhen urges or thoughts appear, use distractions to help you live through the moment. These can be activities that\\nallow you to change your thoughts, emotions and current behaviours. Make a list of the ones you like best and that\\nhelp you focus all of your attention. Try one of these activities for least 30 minutes.\\nRelax: Take a bath or a shower, meditate, take a nap, get a massage, practice yoga or a mindfulness\\nexercise. o Physical exercise: Anything that gets you moving like walking, running, dancing, cycling,\\nrollerblading, swimming. Being outside is even better.\\nMental exercise: Read, watch a movie, do a puzzle or crossword, build something, bake something.\\nConnect with others: Talk to someone, hang out with someone, go online or just go out in crowds.\\nHow else can you distract yourself when you’re struggling?\\n \\n____________________________________________\\n6. Soothe yourself\\n \\nSoothe yourself by doing things that make your senses happy.\\nSound: Listen to music you enjoy, or a CD of relaxing sounds, a podcast, or focus on complete silence.\\nSight: Watch a “feel good” movie or TV show, read a book, ﬁnd inspirational pictures online or old pictures\\nthat make you happy, look at art you enjoy.\\nTaste: Eat one of your favorite foods, chew gum, enjoy a lollipop, drink tea or hot chocolate,or enjoy melting\\nchocolate in your mouth.\\nSmell: Surround yourself with nice smells, like a favorite perfume, incense, or just the outdoors.\\nTouch: Make yourself comfortable in your favorite PJs, hold on to your favorite stuﬀed animal (or real one),\\ntake a warm bath or a cool shower. \\n7. Build your Life\\n \\nYou may be in a rough place right now, but it really is possible to build a life you really want to live. But you need\\nto take this one step at a time.\\n \\nAsk yourself some questions ﬁrst:\\nWhat’s important to you?\\nWhat would you hate to lose?\\nWhat would you like more of in your life? Less of? \\nPick something you’d like to have, develop or improve (a goal). Get support to help you reach your goal, and talk\\nabout the steps you need to take to get where you’d like to be. Some examples: \\nRelationships: You can work on repairing them, reach out for new ones or end destructive ones. Invest in\\nyour relationship with yourself by taking care of your body and challenging negative self talk.\\nActivities or hobbies: Activities or hobbies that make you feel good and bring positive experiences. This\\nmight mean spending time on activities you’re already involved in. Or it might mean trying something new,\\njoining a club or volunteering with a group (a great way to meet new people and make friends).\\nReligion, faith and spirituality: Whatever our beliefs, exploring our faith or spirituality can help us ﬁnd\\nmeaning and purpose in our lives.\\nTake care of your body: Getting enough sleep and proper nutrition will help you handle everyday struggles\\nbetter. Sleep can sometimes be diﬃcult, but try to get into a routine that gives you at least 8-10 hours of\\nsleep each night. \\nEmergency Action Plan\\nMaking an emergency action plan ahead of time is helpful and will reduce stress if it is ever needed.

It tends to run in families.\\nStressful life events: Many people with intense emotions have experienced extremely stressful life situations\\n(e.g. abuse, neglect, parental separation or divorce, family stresses), or even abuse and/or trauma.

Go for a walk, take in a movie, play\\na board game, bake or build something together. When you make a plan for regular ‘special time’ or\\n‘bonding time’ with just you and your loved one, you are showing that person that you value them.\\nSpecial time or bonding is the time to build relationships, not to have diﬃcult conversations.\\nDo you ﬁnd that your loved one is expecting too much of others?\\nIf so, gently set clear expectations with your loved one about what others (including you) can\\nand cannot do, to avoid you from becoming overwhelmed yourself.\\nExample\\nYou may need to make it clear that you need a little time to yourself to recharge.

They can also be an\\nextremely stressful time of year. The good news is that there are things you can do to help you\\ncope.\\nIntroduction\\nAh, the holidays! They can be a time to celebrate and relax. But holidays can also be diﬃcult and stressful,\\nespecially when you feel pressure to have a wonderful, perfect time. \\n \\nThe good news: there are many things you can do to help you and your family members cope with the holidays.\\nTips for Surviving the Holidays\\nKeep up with healthy routines. Holidays can be physically and emotionally demanding. Stick to healthy\\nroutines. Try not to overindulge, because it can make you feel even more exhausted and physically unwell.\\n \\nGet enough sleep.  If you don’t usually get enough sleep, then the holidays are a great chance to catch up\\non some Z’s by going to bed earlier.\\n \\nGet outside.  If you don’t usually get fresh air, now’s your chance to get outside for a walk. Studies show\\nthat even with bad weather, we get health beneﬁts from being outside. As the Swedes say, “There’s no bad\\nweather, just bad clothing.” In other words, dress more warmly.  Consider asking someone else to go for a\\nwalk with you. There’s a good chance they want to do the same thing.  \\n \\nEat properly.  Are you going to a holiday party? Before going, eat enough so that you aren’t starving and\\ncan resist not-so-healthy foods. If you do arrive hungry, get a small plate and ﬁll up on veggies and fruit\\nﬁrst.\\n \\nLimit alcohol. Social gatherings can tempt us to indulge in alcohol, especially if there’s pressure from\\nothers. If you feel pressured, be ready to say: “Thanks, but I’m good.” “Thanks, but I’m driving.” “Thanks,\\nbut I think I’m coming down with something.” “Thanks, but I’m getting over a bad ﬂu so I need to take it', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Surviving the Christmas, Winter Holidays and Festive Season.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

We all want to be loved and accepted by others, but in the end, the most important is\\nto accept ourselves and show self-compassion.\\nAccept that the holidays are not going to be perfect. In fact, they may be even more stressful than\\nother times. You may feel pressure to be happy, but it’s okay to have diﬃcult feelings, including\\nsadness, anxiety, frustration and anger.\\nAccept that you are not alone. Other people are also having an imperfect holiday, and that’s part of\\nbeing human.  \\nAre you having a hard time with the holidays?

When planning for\\nfamily gatherings and social functions, consider asking your host questions so that you’ll know what to\\nexpect:\\nHow many people will be there? Who will be there?\\nWhat’s the schedule?\\nIs there is a quiet place where I can chill out if things get overwhelming?\\nMake a plan for getting home (cab fare, bus routes and fares, etc.).\\n \\nLimit demands and obligations . Especially if you are coping with depression or anxiety, accept that it\\nmight be a challenge to participate in the same way you did in the past.\\nAre you getting stressed from having too many social obligations or expectations? Do you have trouble\\nsaying no? When asked, you can say something like: “Thank you for asking me. I appreciate you thinking\\nabout me. I’ll have to check my schedule.” It’s the holidays – you deserve (and need) a break to rest and\\nrecover.\\n \\nConnect with others. Holidays are a time to connect with others. You might consider calling up a family\\nmember or friend and making plans to get together.\\n \\nSupport others by just listening and accepting. Are you stressed because you have loved ones who\\nare unhappy?

Over time, tantrums typically improve as the child develops the\\ncapacity for self-expression and self-regulation, with support from caregivers. However, some\\nchildren’s tantrums can be quite severe, causing problems at home and in other settings such\\nas daycare and school. Fortunately, most children grow out of their tantrums by age 4. The good\\nnews is that there are many things that caregivers can do to model and teach the skills to\\novercome tantrums, such as self-regulation skills, frustration tolerance and communication.\\nJane’s Story: “My knee hurts!” Part 1\\nJane is a 3-yo who falls at the playground. She starts crying and runs over to you. She seems physically ﬁne, but\\nemotionally upset. \\nWhat would you do?\\na)  Angrily say: “Stop crying, nothing’s broken, you’re ﬁne!”\\nb)  Give her a hug: “Oh my, you’ve hurt yourself. Let’s go back home where you can rest.” \\nc)  Give her a hug until she stops crying, and with any luck, she’ll return to playing again after.\\nDave’s Story: “I want a cookie!”, Part 1\\nDave is a 3 ½ -year old who is just about ﬁnishing the last chocolate cookie. He says, “I want a cookie!” You say to\\nhim: “There are no more cookies!” He gets angry, throws his drink on the ﬂoor and starts to cry.\\nWhat would you do?\\na)  Punish him for being ungrateful and send him to his room. \\nb)  Model self-expression for him by saying, “You’re frustrated! You want another cookie!”; then oﬀer a hug to help\\nhim calm down. \\nc)  Drive to the store to get more cookies.\\nWhat is a Temper Tantrum?\\nTemper tantrums are the severe outbursts of frustration and anger often seen in young children.

       " Document(page_content='Page 2 / 6\\nTantrums usually start around age 1- 1 ½, and get worse between age 2 to 3 (the so-called “terrible twos”).\\nAround this time, toddlers are starting to develop a sense of autonomy, with their own wishes, preferences and\\ndesires.\\nAt times however, this comes into conﬂict with the wishes and preferences of their adult caregivers, and as a\\nresult, this can lead to frustration and tantrums.\\nIt helps when caregivers can:\\nEmpathize and validate the child’s frustration, so the child develops the capacity to identify and express\\ntheir own feelings.\\nProvide soothing (such as giving a hug to a child) so the child develops the capacity to self-soothe and self-\\nregulate over time.\\nAfter many cycles of learning how to deal with tantrums from an adult caregiver, eventually the child learns to self-\\nregulate on their own.\\nAs a result, tantrums usually start getting better around 3, and usually disappear by age 4.\\nNonetheless, some children continue to have trouble with emotional regulation. Even older children, adolescents\\nand adults can have temper tantrums when overwhelmed.\\nProblematic Tantrums\\nSome children have tantrums much more severe than others their age.

Identify the issue\\nWhat is the issue or fear that you are focusing on?\\nMy issue / fear is ____________________________ (e.g. anxiety, stress, worry about exams, etc.)\\nNote that sometimes, your issue is related to another person’s behaviour. But you can’t change other people’s\\nbehaviours, only your reaction. So if your issue is “my boss acts like a jerk”, you can’t change that -- however, you\\ncan try to improve your reaction, “My issue is staying calm when my boss is challenging.”\\n2. How severe is the stress?\\nAsk yourself, between 0 and 10, if 0 is no stress and 10 is the most stress, how stressful is the issue? This helps\\nyou see later on, if the tapping has been helpful or not.\\n3. The setup\\nThe “setup” is where you have a phrase that summarizes the issue you are trying to address -- it has two parts:\\nAcknowledging the issues\\nAccepting yourself despite the problem\\nThe common setup phrase is: “Even though I have this [fear or problem], I accept myself.”\\nWrite down set up phrase below:\\nProblem acknowledgement “Even though I have this problem with _______________________”\\nPositive aﬃrmation “I love and accept myself…”\\nInsert any other positives you want to reinforce here as well…\\n4. Tapping sequence\\nTapping sequence is where you tap through the various acupressure meridian points.\\nWhile tapping each point, say your reminder phrase -- the reminder phrase is just a quick phrase that reminds you\\nabout what you are working on.\\nSo if your problem / aﬃrmation phrase is this:\\n“Even though I have anxiety when I leave my house, I accept myself,”\\nYour reminder phrase could simply be “the anxiety…”\\nMy reminder phrase is _________________________________________________\\nRecite this phrase at each tapping point.\\nRepeat two or three times.\\n5.

Tics\\nare repeated, sudden, movements caused by the person\\'s brain. Note that tics themselves are\\nharmless, but are often treated when they start causing social problems at school, work or\\nhome. Eﬀective treatments exist, include types of behaviour therapy as well as medications.\\nIntroduction\\nWe all get thoughts in our heads and urges to do things. For example:\\nYou might get an itch inside your nose, and feel like you want to pick it, but you know that if you\\'re talking\\nwith your boss, you have to suppress it.\\nYou might see someone really smelly, but you keep that thought to yourself.\\nSomeone is rude to you, and you feel like swearing at them, but you don\\'t actually say anything.\\nMost of us are lucky because we have \"brakes\" that keep us acting out every single thought that we have.\\n \\nBut imagine what it would be like if you had ‘leaky brakes\\' (in the words of Dr. Duncan McKinlay), and your body\\nacted out every thought that you had? Worse, what would it be like if others pointed out your tics and laughed at\\nyou?\\n \\nThat\\'s what life can be like for people with tics or Tourette syndrome...  \\nWhat are Tics?\\nTics are:\\nRepeated, sudden movements or sounds that a person makes, and can happen in the face (e.g. twitching in\\nthe face) or body (e.g. jerking of the hands, arms, or legs.)\\nInvoluntary, meaning that the person is not purposely doing them. In many cases, the person may not even\\nbe aware that they are doing it.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Tic Disorders and Tourette Syndrome.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Page 2 / 5\\nWhat Causes Tics?\\nBasically, part of the brain responsible for controlling the person's muscles is ‘auto-pilot' and doing things on its\\nown, like what happens when you have an cough or a sneeze.\\n \\nTics can be controlled for a short periods of time, but it requires a lot of brain power and mental eﬀort to do so.\\nAnd then later on, usually those ‘pent up' tics get released later on.\\n \\nCommon examples would include a child who controls their tics in class, but then releases it at recess, or an adult\\nwho controls tics during their workday, and then releases it after going home.\\nWhat Types of Tics are there? \\nTics can be classiﬁed in a few ways, as being motor or vocal, as well as being simple and complex.\\n \\n1. Motor tics are movements in the head, arms, legs or other parts of the body.\\nSimple motor tics are involuntary, rapid sudden movements, and look like a 'muscle spasm.' Examplesa.\\ninclude:\\nEye blinking,\\nFacial grimacing,\\nHead bobbing,\\nShoulder shrugging.\\nComplex motor tics use more than one muscle group, and may appear like the person is doing them onb.\\npurpose. Examples include:\\nEchopraxia: Copying moements movements made by others;\\nCopropraxia: Performing obscene or forbidden gestures;\\nKicking, skipping, jumping, smelling objects.\\n2. Vocal tics are where the person makes noises.\\nSimple vocal tics involve a single muscle group. Examples include:a.\\nGrunting,\\nSnorting,\\nCoughing,\\nSniﬃng.\\nComplex vocal tics involve more than one muscle group, and can seem like the person is doing it onb.\\npurpose. Examples include: \\nBarking, whistling \\nCoprolalia: Swearing, or may even make racist, sexist remarks, that can be extremely oﬀensive\\nif others do not understand.\\nEcholalia: Repeating sounds, words or phrases that the person hears from others.\\nPalilalia: Repeating one's own sounds or words.\\nWhat Causes Tics?\\nThough in the past people with tics may have been blamed for having their tics, it is nowadays understood that\\nthese individuals have a genetic diﬀerence which causes imbalances in certain brain chemicals.\\n \\nIn some cases, this genetic diﬀerence is passed on from parents, whereas in others it seems to arise on its own.\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Tic Disorders and Tourette Syndrome.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Page 3 / 5\\nTic Disorders and Tourette Syndrome\\nWhen a person has tics, it is called a tic disorder. \\n \\nWhen a person has both motor and vocal tics that have been present for over a year, it is called Tourette\\nsyndrome (aka Gilles de la Tourette syndrome).\\nHow Common are Tics and Tourette Syndrome?\\nAs many as 10-20% of all school-age children have motor and/or vocal tics that go away within a year (Bagheri et\\nal., 1999).\\n \\nIn 3-4% of school age children, symptoms of either motor or vocal tics will last more than  a year (Leckman et al.,\\n2001). These children would be considered to have a chronic tic disorder. Children with both vocal and motor tics\\nthat persist for more than 1 year generally meet criteria for Tourette syndrome.\\nIf You Suspect Tics or Tourette Syndome\\nIf you suspect that your child has tics or Tourette's, then take your child to a family doctor or paediatrician. The\\ndoctor can do a closer examination, and then recommend other services if necessary.\\n \\nAlthough in the past it was believed that Tourette Syndrome was lifelong, newer evidence suggests that the\\nsymptoms are worst around at age 10-12, and that symptoms improve over adolescence  (Leckman et al.,\\nPediatrics, 1998).\\nOther Conditions Seen Along with Tics and Tourette Syndrome\\nPatients with Tourette's syndrome may have other conditions as well, and it is often these other conditions that\\ncause the main challenges than simply the tics, such as:   \\n \\nObsessive compulsion disorder\\n(OCD)Condition where individuals have obsessions (distressing, repetitive thoughts or\\nimages, e.g. fears of germs) and/or compulsions (repetitive habits or rituals that a\\nperson feels compelled to do repeatedly, e.g. handwashing.)\\nAttention deﬁcit hyperactivity\\ndisorder (ADHD)Problem with inattention and hyperactivity to the point where it causes problems in\\nlife. \\nProblems with anger or rage Problems with anger causing problems in life. \\nMental rigidity, Problems getting stuck on certain ideas or activities, to the point where it causes\\nproblems, e.g.  arguments with others.\\nLearning disorders Problems with learning in a speciﬁc area, such as reading, mathematics. \\nAnxiety problems Worries that are so severe that it causes problems with life.\\n \\nSupporting Someone with Tics and Tourette Syndrome\\nThere are many ways you can help someone with tics and Tourette's. \\nDo accept that they have a tic disorder, and help others understand them as well. Just like we'd\\naccept someone who has other brain diﬀerences such a seizure disorder, it is important to accept them and\\nsupport them. Unfortunately, people with tics are often misunderstood, teased or rejected because others\\ndo not understand. Educate family members and teachers about the child's tics so that they oﬀer support to\\nthe child. Consider asking your health professionals, or contact Tourette's associations for more information\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Tic Disorders and Tourette Syndrome.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 4 / 5\\nabout how to educate others.\\nDo not blame. Although many children with tics can suppress them (such as during school hours), the urge\\nto tic is still there, and often must eventually be released. However, because a child is often tic-free for long\\nperiods, often adults mistakenly believe that it is just simply a matter of willpower, and will thus use\\ndiscipline or punishment to prevent tics. This approach to tics is not eﬀective, just as you wouldn\\'t discipline\\nor punish a child who has seizures.\\nTreatment for Tics\\nMild tics that do not cause severe diﬃculties or get in the way of life are usually not treated.\\n \\nModerate to severe tics however, that cause problems at home, work or school, may be treated with behavioural\\ntherapies or medications \\n \\n1. Behavioural Therapy (BT) for Tics \\n \\nThere are diﬀerent behavioural therapies that may be helpful.\\n \\nFor example, \"habit reversal\" shows some promise for mild, non-severe tics. Habit reversal involves training\\noneself to replace the problematic tic behavior with a diﬀerent, less impairing behavior. \\n \\nThe person with tics is taught how to: \\nIdentify warning signals, or feelings that come before getting a tic (premonitory feelings).\\nE.g. If the child has a tic that makes him/her tilt the head to the left, the child is taught to tilt the head to the\\nright.\\nOnce the person is aware of the tic, then the person is taught actions to cancel out the tic.\\nAdvantages / Disadvantages of Behavioural Therapy  \\n \\nBehavioural therapies do not have side eﬀects, unlike medications. However, it can be challenging to do if one\\'s\\nsymptoms are severe, particularly with younger children. \\n \\n2. Medications for Tics include:\\nAlpha adrenergic agonists, e.g. clonidine (Catapres), guanfacine (Intuniv)\\nDopamine blocking medications, e.g. Risperidone (Risperdal), Olanzapine (Zyprexa), Aripiprazole (Abilify)\\nAdvantages / Disadvantages of Medications: Medications can be helpful for more severe cases especially if other\\nstrategies (such as behaviour strategies) haven\\'t worked.\\n \\nIf the person with tics has other conditions such as ADHD/ADD  (attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder / attention\\ndeﬁcit disorder), anxiety conditions such as obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and rage attacks, then\\ntreatments (such as medications) may be helpful for those conditions as well.\\nWhere to Find Help?\\nSee your family physician / pediatrician to explore whether it is tics or Tourettes, and to see whether or not it\\nwould be helpful to get a referral to other specialists such as neurologists or psychiatrists. \\n \\nFor behavioural therapies, usually it is provided by psychologists.

It is the\\nperception of sounds in the absence of external noise.\\nChildren are less likely to mention such sounds as they often think it is normal. You usually will not know unless\\nyou directly ask them, “Are you hearing any sounds right now, like ringing?”\\nTypes of sounds include ringing, whistling, roaring, clicking, hissing, buzzing and humming.\\nThe sound can:\\nBe constant, occasional or intermittent.\\nSeem like it is coming from one side or both sides.\\nHow Common Is It?\\nTinnitus is very common. It is about as common in children as it is in adults.\\nWhat Causes Tinnitus?\\nTinnitus is usually a sign of inner ear damage that causes auditory processes to malfunction.\\nThere are many possible causes for tinnitus which include the following:\\nNoise exposure\\nPermanent hearing loss, congenital or acquired\\nConductive hearing loss\\nWax build-up in the ear canal\\nEar or sinus infections\\nEar injuries, such as from poking an object too far into the ear\\nAbnormal growth of the middle ear bones', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Tinnitus.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Especially if a person is young, they may not know that\\nothers cannot hear the sound and may not think about telling you.\\nFor other people, the sounds can be distressing and cause problems such as:\\nSensitivity to noise. The person might get distressed in a noisy environment, or they try to avoid noisy\\nsituations.\\nQuiet avoidance. Some people might be the opposite and have more diﬃculties in quiet environments.\\nDiﬃculty paying attention or listening to others, unexplained listening diﬃculties.\\nPoor academic performance.\\nDiﬃculties with sleep.

       " Document(page_content=\"Page 3 / 4\\nWhere to Find Help\\nStart by seeing your primary care provider (e.g. family physician), who will start by looking for medical conditions\\nthat might be contributing to tinnitus.\\nDepending on the speciﬁc situation, the doctor might recommend other professionals such as:\\nAudiologist: An audiologist can do hearing tests.\\nOtolaryngologist (aka ENT or ear nose throat doctor): An ENT can assess for any treatable ear, nose or\\nthroat condition.\\nTreatments for Tinnitus\\nIs there an underlying cause for the tinnitus? If so, then treating the underlying cause may be helpful such as:\\n• Is there earwax blockage? If so, then removing earwax may help.\\n• Is there a blood vessel condition? If so, then treating the blood vessel condition may help.\\n• Is your tinnitus related to hearing loss (age-related or\\nnoise-related)?If so, then hearing aids may help.\\n• Is your tinnitus related to medications? If so, then adjusting medications may help.\\nMedications\\nIn some cases, medications may be helpful. Note, however, that no medical treatment has been approved in\\nCanada to treat tinnitus directly. Speak with your physician about it.\\nTinnitus retraining therapy (TRT)\\nTRT is a program oﬀered by an audiologist that teaches people how to cope with their tinnitus, consciously\\nand subconsciously. It is a combination of counselling and therapy. It can also be used with other types of\\ntreatment.\\nCounselling, group therapy, or CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)\\nSeeing a psychologist or psychotherapist can help you learn techniques to help you cope with tinnitus.\\nWill It Get Better?\\nThe answer depends on the cause behind the tinnitus. It may get better or go away on its own after a certain time.\\nFor instance, if you develop tinnitus after going to a concert, it might go away by itself after a few days of auditory\\nrest. It may get better if the underlying condition is treated.

It involves placing an\\nelectromagnetic coil against your scalp near the forehead. It is painless, non-invasive, and can\\nbe useful when other treatments have not helped or as an alternative to medication.\\nWhat is TMS?\\nTMS is a treatment that directs magnetic energy pulses at speciﬁc parts of the brain that are involved in brain\\nconditions such as depression.\\nIt is felt that in conditions such as depression, there is an imbalance in brain activity.\\nMagnetic pulses pass painlessly through the skull, and stimulate brain cells, helping with ‘neuromodulation’, i.e.\\nrebalancing healthy patterns of activity.\\nTMS is a relatively new treatment compared to other treatments and requires special equipment. TMS is usually\\nused when other usual treatments have been tried without success (e.g. talking therapy, medication or other\\ntreatments) (MacMaster, 2019; Voigt, 2019).\\nTerms\\nBecause the magnetic pulses in TMS are repetitive, it is also known as repetitive TMS (rTMS).\\nWhat Does TMS Help With?\\nIn Canada, TMS is a Health Canada-approved treatment for major depressive disorder. Similarly in the USA, TMS is\\nFDA-approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder.\\nTMS is also being studied for other conditions such as eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),\\nchronic pain, migraines, ﬁbromyalgia, Tourette syndrome, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), multiple sclerosis and\\nothers.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS).pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Due to the strong magnetic ﬁeld\\nproduced during TMS, the procedure is not recommended for some people who have metallic devices\\nclose to the stimulation site such as aneurysm clips or coils; stents; implanted stimulators such as\\nvagus nerve or deep brain stimulators, pacemakers, medication pumps; cochlear implants; any\\nmagnetic implants; bullet fragments or any metal or objects in your body.\\nAny medications you are taking;\\nFamily history of seizures or a family history of epilepsy.\\nAny past brain damage from illness or injury, such as a brain tumour, a stroke or a traumatic brain\\ninjury.\\nAny problems with frequent or severe headaches.\\nDuring Each Treatment Session\\nTreatment sessions involve sitting in a comfortable chair, with earplugs, with a magnetic coil placed against your\\nhead, and you will be awake during the whole time. When the machine is activated, you will hear clicking sounds\\nand feel tapping on your forehead.\\nTypically, treatment involves 40-min. sessions, done once daily, ﬁve days a week (Mon-Fri), for 4-6 weeks.\\nNewer TMS technologies, such as theta-burst stimulation (TBS) are much quicker, involving only 3-4 min. Daily\\nsessions are done ﬁve days a week (Mon-Fri) for 4-6 weeks. This requires newer versions of TMS devices.\\nAfter treatment, you can resume normal activities, including working and driving as usual.\\nWill It Work For Me?\\nAbout half of people who receive TMS for depression at the University Health Network (UHN) in Toronto show\\nsigniﬁcant improvement in their symptoms (Chandler J, 2016).\\nHow Long Does It Take to Work?\\nIf TMS works for you, you will hopefully see an improvement in your symptoms within a few weeks. And over the\\nfull course of 4-6 weeks, you will hopefully see signiﬁcant improvement -- and ideally, the depression will\\ncompletely resolve.\\nHow Much Does It Cost?\\nTMS is covered in Canada by provincial health plans in Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Yukon, which means you do\\nnot have to pay in these provinces.\\nTMS is not yet covered in other provinces, which means you may have to pay for the service out of pocket.\\nHowever:\\nIf you have an extended health plan, it may cover some of the costs.\\nSome health care centres do oﬀer the service for free even if it is not covered.\\nCentres that conduct research (such as CAMH in Toronto, the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre in Ottawa)\\nmay be able to oﬀer state-of-the-art treatment for free if you are involved in a clinical trial.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS).pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

With the longer duration TMS, there may be scalp pain during\\ntreatment, similar to the feeling of static electricity (Chandler, 2016). Some patients will take ibuprufen (Advil) or\\nacetaminophen (Tylenol) before treatment to deal with this.\\nSummary of Advantages / Disadvantages of TMS\\nAdvantages of TMS compared to other treatments:\\nIt is a safe, well-tolerated and painless procedure.\\nThere are no side eﬀects on memory or cognitive/intellectual function.\\nUnlike electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), it does not require anesthesia, nor does it require someone to drive\\nyou home afterwards.\\nUnlike medications, there are much fewer side eﬀects.\\nIt works relatively quickly (e.g. within a matter of weeks).\\nYou can resume your usual daily activity (e.g. driving/work) between sessions.\\nDisadvantages of TMS are:\\nIn many cases, patients may have to pay for TMS because it is not yet covered by most provincial health\\ninsurance plans. The average range is a few thousand dollars however this is within the same range that a\\ncourse of psychotherapy of 10-20 visits might cost as well. \\nIt requires daily weekday visits to the hospital or clinic for TMS, for 4-6 weeks.\\nUnlike psychotherapy, you do not learn skills and coping strategies.\\nThe most serious risk is inducing a seizure (about 1 in 10,000 cases), but fortunately, this is quite rare.\\nAbout this Article\\nWritten by Sara Tremblay, Ph.D., Royal Ottawa and the eMentalHealth.ca Team.

The term trichotillomania comes from the Greek words\\ntrich (for hair), tillo (pulling) and mania (an impulse).\\nOn one hand, it is normal for human beings have grooming behaviours for body function and hygiene, such as\\npulling out unwanted hair. \\nOn the other hand, pulling out excessive hairs can lead to noticeable bald spots. Due to societal pressure to have\\nhair, many people may react negatively when they see their loved one with bald spots.  \\nOutside of their hair pulling however, many adult individuals with trichotillomania report that they otherwise\\nlead perfectly normal lives. \\nHow Common is Hair Pulling?\\nIt is very hard to estimate how common hair pulling occurs, because few individuals with hair pulling seek\\nprofessional help. However, surveys of college students have shown that 1-2% have had past or current symptoms\\nof trichotillomania (eMedicine.com, 2006). Although the average age of onset for hair pulling is age 13, there are\\npeaks of onset in children at age 5-8 as well as in teenagers at age 13 (DSM-IV-TR, 2000).\\nWhat are the Symptoms of Hair Pulling?\\nSymptoms that the person may have are:\\nIrresistible urges to pull out one\\'s hair, to the point that the person develops noticeable hairless or bald\\nspots.\\nA cycle of rising tension and anxiety, which gets better from hair pulling, which leads to a vicious cycle\\nbecause the person learns that hair pulling helps them feel better (in the short run).\\nDistress and interference with daily life.\\nHairballs: Hairballs are a rare but potentially serious symptom. Some individuals will play with, nibble or\\nswallow their hairs after they have pulled them. If they swallow enough hair, it leads to a hairball\\n(trichobezoar) in their digestive system. Symptoms of hairballs include: stomach pain, bloated abdomen,', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Trichotillomania.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

In these cases, it is important that the\\nperson see a doctor promptly.  \\nSigns that others may notice include:\\nThe person starts concealing their head, by wearing hats, kerchiefs, or wigs.\\nAny changes in social behavior, or decline in marks.\\nWhat Triggers Hair Pulling?\\nUsual triggers include:\\nExperiencing stressful life situations, which can then trigger stress, anxiety and depression. In such cases,\\nhair pulling might be a way of trying to cope or deal with stress.  \\nSedentary activities, e.g. such as reading, talking on the phone, doing schoolwork, or getting ready for bed.\\nIn these cases, hair pulling might be the brain's way of trying to increase stimulation or keep occupied.  \\nAre You Wondering about Trichotillomania?\\nAre you an adult? \\nIf so, then consider seeing your primary care provider to see if there are other contributing medical issues,\\nor life issues.\\nAre you a parent, and suspect that your child has trichotillomania?\\nIf so, then start by having your child seen by a medical doctor (such as a family physician or paediatrician).\\nThe doctor may recommend more specialized mental health services or professionals such as a psychologist\\nor psychiatrist.\\nHow is Hair Pulling Treated?\\nTrichotillomania can be treated with:\\n \\n1. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) , which focuses on changing thoughts (cognitions) and behaviors in order\\nto help a person overcome the trichotillomania.\\n \\nStrategies include:\\nAwareness training: helping the person become more aware of when s/he is pulling their hair, as it often\\nhappens without thinking about it. For example, keeping a hair pulling diary to note when and where it\\noccurs and how strong the urges are.\\nStimulus control: making changes to a person's environment so that it discourages or doesn't support hair\\npulling.\\nSince hair pulling often happens when the person is inactive and alone some helpful strategies might\\ninclude:\\nBeing around other people\\nWearing gloves or wearing band aid adhesive strips on one's ﬁngers to make it harder to pull hairs.\\nHabit reversal strategies: learning alternate activities to do instead of pulling.\\nExamples include:\\nExamples include: sculpting with clay; hulling sunﬂower seeds; playing with Koosh ® balls; playing with\\n‘stress' balls; Chinese exercise/massage balls.\\n2. Medications  such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are sometimes used for hair pulling.\\nExamples include Fluoxetine (Prozac), Zoloft (Sertraline), Citalopram (Celexa) and Escitalopram (Cipralex).\\n \", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Trichotillomania.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 3 / 4\\nIn general however, medications are used only when other interventions such as CBT have not been successful.\\nThis is because studies (in adults) have shown cognitive behavioural therapy to be more eﬀective than medications\\n(Bloch et al., 2007).\\nSupporting Your Loved One with Trichotillomania\\nDon\\'t be a therapist: First of all, remember that as a parent, relative or friend, you are not that person\\'s\\ntherapist. Trying to be a therapist, or telling someone with trichotillomania what to do may backﬁre if they aren\\'t\\nready or willing to accept your advice! Instead, ask your child, \"How can I support you? How can I be\\nhelpful?\"\\n \\nTake care of physical Needs : Ensure proper sleep and exercise. Numerous studies have shown that exercise\\ncan reduce stress and anxiety (University of Missouri-Columbia, 2003). The Canadian Pediatric Society\\nrecommends that children should be active at least 90 minutes per day (Canadian Pediatric Society, 2002).\\n \\nKeeping a calm environment: People with anxiety do better when is predictable and calm, when they know\\nwhat is expected of them. \\nSupport your loved one with any stresses.  The fact that your loved is having trichotillomania may indicate\\nthat they are experiencing stress. \\nTypical stresses and problems that children face include: \\nSchool (academics, teachers, peers)\\nFriend and peer stress such as peer conﬂicts, bullying, peer pressure and drugs\\nHome (worries about family ﬁnances, ﬁghting or tension between family members); \\nFriends and boyfriends/ girlfriends. \\nAsk your loved one about how things are going in the above areas, and see if they are struggling with certain\\nareas. \\n \\nDon\\'t blame: For people who do not have trichotillomania, it can be frustrating dealing with a friend or family\\nmember who does have trichotillomania.

Could devices be\\ngetting in the way of relationships in your family? Read more to learn about ways your family\\ncan unplug and connect....\\nIntroduction \\nOur brains are wired to require strong relationships, attachments and face-to-face social contact with fellow human\\nbeings for happiness and well-being. Good relationships and healthy bonds to others keep us resilient and allow us\\nto bounce back from setbacks. Unfortunately, our technologies and devices are so addictive, that many people are\\nmore connected to their devices than each other. The very devices that were meant to make life easier for us are\\nnow threatening to disconnect us from one another and thus, damage our physical and emotional health...\\n \\nChildren and youth now use technologies that did not exist just when their parents were kids. These devices have\\nadded greatly to our quality of life. At the same time, they can get in the way of physical activity or true social and\\nemotional ties with others. When this happens, it can have a negative impact on relationships, mental and physical\\nhealth. \\n \\nUsing technology more and more may cause us to connect less and less with each other. We may also connect less\\nwith our children. Mental health professionals are becoming concerned, because they are seeing more and more\\nyouth with emotional and behavioural problems. Strong bonds between parents, children and youth are more\\nimportant than ever.\\n \\nFor example, technology: \\nCan draw our attention away from real people. It has become so advanced (and addictive) that it seems\\nmany people prefer to interact with a device than with their spouse, friends, or children. Go to any public\\nplace, and you will ﬁnd many people more focused on their device than the people they are with. \\nCan make bullying, harassment and exploitation easier. Nasty comments, rumours and regrettable photos\\nspread like viruses, and don’t stop at your front door. And because online communication isn’t face to face,\\npeople are more likely to write things they would never say in person. \\nCan make it easier for children and youth to connect more with peers than parents. Of course it’s important\\nfor children and youth to have friends. And friends do become even more important through the teen years.\\nBut friends simply can’t provide the love, emotional support and guidance that parents can. For healthy\\ndevelopment, children and youth must have strong bonds with parents. When this bond is strong, children\\nand youth turn to their parents for help in diﬃcult times. Friends may not always be there when the going\\ngets tough. But parents will. And parents are in the best position to help. \\nEats up our time so that we have less time to do healthy things like spending time with family and friends,', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Unplug and Connect_ Keeping Families Strong in a Wired World.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Homework doesn’t count. \\nAnswering ‘yes’ to any of these questions may mean your child or teen is becoming too attached to technology. \\n \\nPlease note, children 2-4 years should have no more than 1 hour of screen time each day.

This can help\\nfamilies to connect with each other. \\n \\n1. Spend Quality Time Together \\nSpend tech-free time alone with your child or teen. Aim for some time together every day. This gets harder\\nas teens get older and schedules get busier, but do your best. This will give you a chance to talk and listen. \\n \\nFor example:\\nRead together; \\nGo for a walk; \\nPlay a board game; \\nCook, bake or clean up together; \\nTeach your child or teen how to do something; \\nVolunteer together; \\nGo out for a treat; \\nPlay outside. \\n2. Have Non-Technology Activities \\nMake sure everyone spends time outside in greenspace. Studies show that being in nature has a positive\\nimpact on our minds and bodies. In fact, some believe that many of us suﬀer from ‘nature deﬁcit disorder’. \\n \\nCreate chances for creative, free play.

Set limits on technology \\nThink carefully before bringing new technology into your child’s life. Think ahead about how old your child\\nshould be before having a phone or gaming device. It’s easier to put oﬀ getting one than it is to take a\\ndevice away. Consider phone options carefully as well (for example, unlimited texting may not be needed). \\n \\nSet limits on ‘tech time’ when your children are young. This sets a pattern of parents making rules for\\ntechnology use. Give your child a certain amount of time each day for screen time (amount of time will\\n depend on your child’s age). They will have to plan on how they use the time, and when time’s up for the\\nday, it’s up. As your children become teens, you can be more ﬂexible, but still have some ‘guidelines’. \\n \\nBabies and children aged 2 and shouldn’t have any screen time at all. A child's brain develops quickly during\\nthese ﬁrst years, and young children learn best by interacting with people, not screens (Canadian Paediatric\\nSociety). \\n \\nParents are children’s best teachers. Young children learn most of their words from parents. Children who\\ncan speak well ﬁnd it easier to succeed in school. \\n \\nLimit recreational screen time for older children and teens to 1 or 2 hours each day (Canadian Paediatric\\nSociety). Recreational screen time means playing video games, using social media or watching videos.\\nChildren and youth who spend more than 2 hours a day on ‘screen time’ are twice as likely to be overweight\\nor obese than youth who spend 1 hour or less each day in front of a screen.\\n \\nSet ‘no tech’ areas in your home\\nKeep technology (like computers, TVs, and video game consoles) out of your children’s bedrooms.\\nHaving devices and screens in the bedroom is very tempting, and makes it easy for your kids to stay\\nup too late.\\n \\nSet ‘no tech’ times:\\nBedtime. Try to limit electronics with screens before bedtime. Light from the screen (‘blue’ light)\\nblocks the brain from making melatonin, the sleep hormone. This ‘tricks’ the brain into thinking it’s\\ndaytime, making it hard to sleep. \\nMealtime. Have dinner together as many nights a week as possible, with no devices allowed\\n(parents too!) This gives everyone a chance to connect with each other. Children and teens can help\\nprepare meals-even young children can help by fetching things or setting the table. This can be a\\nwonderful time to learn about food, family traditions and cooking.\\nHomework time. Set limits on TV and social media during homework time. Older children may need\\nthe computer for homework and research. A little extra stimulation (for example, background music)\\ncan help some children and youth. But most people are less productive when distracted by TV,\\nFacebook, Twitter or Instagram. \\n4. Use technology wisely. \\nSet a good example. Show your children and teens how to balance technology use with other activities. Try\\nto limit your own screen time to when your children are in bed, out of the house or involved in an activity of\\ntheir own.

Even so, the world\\ncan still seem like a scary and overwhelming place at times. Children can learn about upsetting\\nnews stories through news media and other people, even if they are not directly aﬀected by the\\nevents. Children can ﬁnd these news stories too much to handle, especially because they can’t\\ndo anything about them. Fortunately, there are many things that parents can do to support\\nchildren and to help them cope with their fears.\\nChristopher's Story, Part 1\\nChristopher is a 10-year old boy who heard about a recent terrorist attack on the news. Ever since then, he is\\nworried when parents leave the house, and is having trouble sleeping at night. When he expresses his fear, his\\nfather tells him not to worry.\\n \\nHis dad reminds him that it’s safe in their home, that they have a security system, and that they can call the police\\nif they have trouble. But Chris is still anxious, no matter how much his parents try to reason with him.\\nWhat News Events are Upsetting for Children?\\nWe all want our children to grow up feeling safe. But almost every day, children are exposed to upsetting news\\nevents on the radio, television or online.\\n \\nUpsetting events can include terrorist attacks, school shootings, car crashes, tornadoes, earthquakes, ﬁres, war,\\noutbreaks of infectious illnesses or natural disasters such as ﬂoods, hurricanes, and droughts.\\n \\nChildren are also exposed to violence through television shows, movies, and video games. Whether it is through\\nplaying violent video games, or our heroes in movies and television, children learn that violence is acceptable.\\nSpecial eﬀects in video and games are now so realistic, that it is diﬃcult for children to ﬁgure out what is real and\\nwhat isn’t. There is research that shows children can become less sensitive to violence by being exposed to it. This\\nmay lead to children having less empathy and being more likely to see violence as acceptable.\\nHow Does an Upsetting News Events Aﬀect Children?\\nChildren are all diﬀerent.  While some children may be quite distressed by such events, others do not seem\\nbothered at all.\\n \\nSome children may react to hearing about scary events by:\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Upsetting News Events_ Helping Your Children and Youth Cope.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Sensitive children are often more easily aﬀected by upsetting news. They feel empathy for\\nothers and are often very caring people. These can be powerful strengths.\\nWhat Parents Can Do Every Day: General Strategies\\n(Continue to) Spend quality time together . Strong, warm bonds between parents and children are the\\nbest ‘buﬀer’ between children and a world that sometimes doesn’t make much sense. Continue to \\nEnsure you have regular 1:1 time set aside to spend with your child, without distractions. This gives\\nyour child a chance to talk and express feelings. You’ll have the chance to listen and show that you\\nunderstand. Reading, playing a game, working on a project, or going for a walk together are all great\\nways to spend one to one time with your child.\\nKeep your children physically safe. This means teaching your children without spanking or hitting; and\\ndon't allow siblings to get physical with each other. Help them solve their conﬂicts by talking about their\\nfeelings. \\nKeep your children emotionally safe.  A child who feels safe will be generally content and happy, will talk\\nto parents about how he or she feels, and will go to parents with problems or diﬃcult feelings.Emotionally\\nsafety includes: \\nTreating children with warmth, aﬀection and age appropriate limits.\\nKeeping expectations that are reasonable and age appropriate.\\nAccepting and validating how your child feels (for example, saying things like “that sounds very sad”\\nas op- posed to “How can you feel sad about that? You’re making such a big deal out of nothing!”)\\nAvoiding telling children they are ‘good’ or ‘bad’. Instead, notice them and what they do. For\\nexample: “That was very kind of you to share your cookie.” “That is a very tall building you made!” \\n“Hitting is not OK-that hurts Alex when you hit. What can you say to him when he takes your toy?”\\nDealing with misbehaviour without yelling, in a calm voice. This is not easy for parents to do, but it is\\ncrucial for parents to model calmness and how to deal with frustration. \\nSpend time outside. Nature soothes and restores our minds and bodies. An added bonus: children are\\nyouth are more physically active when outside.\\nGive children a sense of control by allowing them to make age appropriate decisions. Toddlers can\\npick clothing from a few options, older children can help plan meals, make more decisions about\\nclothing and help decide on family activities.\\nWhat Parents Can Do: Strategies About News Media\\nMonitor and limit what your child sees on news media.  Upsetting stories can be too much for\\nchildren, who can’t do anything to change what is happening.\\nYounger children (Age 5 and under) should not watch the news.\\nWith older children (age 6 and up), watch the news with them.  You’ll be able to see what they are\\nwatching, and can talk with them about what they see. Keep your TV in a common area, so it will be\\neasier to keep on top of what your children see on TV.\\nSet an example and set limits on TV time. Limit the time you spend watching the news. Don’t have\\nnews networks on all the time. Turn oﬀ the TV during dinner, and catch up on what’s happening with the\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/Upsetting News Events_ Helping Your Children and Youth Cope.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

This may be a challenge, but there is a great deal\\nof high quality programming available for children, though you may have to search a little for it. Nature and\\nscience shows are a good option, as is public television programming.\\nWhat Should I do if my Child is Exposed to a Scary News Story?\\nBring it up yourself.  If you hear about an upsetting news event, it is best to discuss it with your children\\nbefore they hear it from others. You might say: “The world is a very big place, and from time to time, you\\nmight hear people talk about scary things that happened in the news. You can always talk with us if you\\nhear about anything that upsets you.”\\nAsk children what they saw or heard.  Start with general questions, like, “What have you heard?” “How\\ndo you feel about that?” Later ask more speciﬁc questions, like, “Did that make you feel upset?” “Are you\\nworried about that?” “What are you worried is going to happen? What’s your worst fear?\"    \\nAllow children to express whatever feelings they are having, for example, fear, anxiety or\\nsadness. For example, if your child says that he is frightened, you could respond by saying something like,\\n“I’m glad you told me how you’re feeling.” It may also help to let your child know that fear is a common\\nreaction. You might say, “A lot of people feel scared when they hear about things like this.”\\nIt doesn’t help for you to ‘correct’ your child’s feelings. Avoid saying things like, “Don’t be silly,\\nthere’s nothing to worry about” or “Big girls (or boys) don’t cry, stop being a baby.” This can teach\\nchildren to hide their feelings from you.\\nCrying is, in fact, is very helpful. When children let their feelings out by crying with a supportive adult,\\ntheir brains learn to adapt to the stress, and are less aﬀected by the stress or worry. This is the same\\nprocess that adults go through when they grieve a loss by crying. This allows us to work through it\\nand move on. Blocking crying is not helpful.\\nReassure your child, after she is calm and open to this . After you have listened and shown that you\\nunderstand her feelings, your child will hopefully be open to logical explanations and reassurance. For\\nexample, you might say “What happened to that family is really scary. It’s not likely that this would happen\\nto us, and this is why…” Give your child the facts, appropriate to the child’s age.\\nCall attention to the helpers in the situation. In every emergency or tragedy, there are people rushing\\nto help: police, nurses, ﬁreﬁghters, paramedics, volunteers, doctors, rescuers. This reminds us of the\\ngoodness in people, that there are always people willing to help.\\nTake control .  Children often feel helpless when a tragedy or natural disaster occurs. If your child is old\\nenough, look for ways your family can help. Can you help raise money? Volunteer as a family? Support\\npeople aﬀected by the events in some way?\\nStick with usual routines.  Children ﬁnd comfort in family routines and regular activities.\\nGive your child a sense of control  by teaching them what they can do to be safe in various situations.\\nFor example:\\nWith COVID: Show them how they can practice physical distancing and wearing a mask. \\nWith ﬁres: Practicing ﬁre scape plans; learning how to call 911. \\nWith car safety: Using a car seat, booster seat or seatbelt (depending on age and size of child).\\nWith head injuries: Wearing helmets for sports\\nWith drownings: Learning about water safety\\nWith getting lost: Teaching them what to do if they get lost (e.g. staying in a public place with lots of\\npeople around, getting help from a store clerk or a family with children)\\nFind some positive meaning and hope out of what has happened . As the expression goes, if life\\ngives you lemons, try to make lemonade. \\nEvent: Demonstrations against police brutality and systemic oppression in the United States. \\nMeaning: \"On one hand, it is sad that there is racism in the United States, and it is sad that\\npeople have died at the hands of police due to racism.

Visual processing problems are when the brain has problems making sense of what it\\nsees. It can cause all manner of problems with school, work and home. A person might become\\noverwhelmed when there is too much visual information to process, such as in a messy or\\ncluttered classroom or public place. The person may lack visual awareness, e.g. being unable to\\nﬁnd something even though it's right in front of them. They may struggle with visual tasks, e.g.,\\nlearning to read, write and math. It may be confused with other issues, such as inattention or\\nlaziness. The person might even be diagnosed with attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder\\n(ADHD), yet the usual treatments, such as strategies and medications, do not work. The good\\nnews is that visual optometrists can help assess and provide recommendations for visual\\nprocessing problems. Various accommodations and modiﬁcations may help at school, work and\\nhome.\\nOverview\\nVisual processing problems occur when the brain makes sense of visual information.

This is diﬀerent from problems involving sight or sharpness of\\nvision and can occur despite normal vision. Classic symptoms include light sensitivity,\\nheadaches from reading, and problems reading because the white “page appears too bright” or\\nthe words appear to be \"moving, ﬂashing, or jumping on the page\". As reading is such a key skill\\nfor school and life in general, problems with reading can thus lead to signiﬁcant impairment. The\\ngood news is that appropriate intervention can make a signiﬁcant improvement and for many\\nindividuals, one of the interventions is as simple as speciﬁc colour ﬁlters.\\nVivian’s Story: “When I read, I get headaches, the light hurts, and the\\nwords move” \\nVivian is a student who has been struggling for a long time. “I want to learn, but I hate school because there\\'s too\\nmuch reading. When I read, I get headaches, the light hurts, and the words move...\"\\n \\nWhen she was younger, she saw many professionals for her reading issues. Her parents were told many opinions\\nincluding: \\n\"Your daughter is lazy -- you just need better discipline to get her to read.\"\\n\"She has attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and that\\'s why she can\\'t focus\" -- yet all the usual\\nADHD treatments including medications have been tried without success.\\nFinally, one day at her yearly eye exam, her eye care professional discovers that when Vivian reads, the words\\n“move up and down and side to side.” Vivian never thought to tell anyone because \"I thought it was like that for\\neveryone else too\"...\\nIs it Visual Stress?\\nIs there any of the following? \\nDo words or letters appear to jump, shake, change or move on a page? \\nDo colours or lights appear to ﬂash or ﬂicker on the page and behind text? \\nDo you struggle with headaches/migraines or eyestrain from reading, homework, computer work or\\nﬂuorescent lighting?

And for many, a part of the solution is as simple as precision\\ncolour ﬁlters.\\nWhat is Visual Stress? \\nVisual stress is a visual perceptual processing condition that results from hyperactivity of the brain’s visual cortex.\\nAs a result, the visual cortex doesn’t process information properly, which can thereby cause problems with reading,\\nattention, coordination, general health and behaviour. \\n \\nVisual stress is not the same as problems involving sight or sharpness of vision; visual stress can occur even if you\\nhave normal vision. \\n \\nSymptoms include:\\nLight sensitivity\\nPhysical discomfort\\nVisual and perceptual distortions.\\nTerms: In the past, visual stress has been called Irlen syndrome, Meares-Irlen syndrome, perceptual dyslexia,\\nvisual dyslexia and scotopic sensitivity (now realized to be a misnomer). \\n \\nVisual stress is the modern term used as it is a broader term and refers to the condition that occurs in a wider\\nrange of neurological conditions. \\nHow Common Is It? \\nVisual stress is experienced by 10-15% of the general population. Certain situations can increase the risk of having\\nvisual stress -- in certain individuals such as those with dyslexia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), speciﬁc learning\\ndiﬃculties, migraines, and brain injuries, visual stress can occur in over 40% of individuals.\\nWhat Triggers Visual Stress?\\nIn people with visual stress, triggers that over excite the brain may include: \\nPatterns or stripes: The contrast of light to dark in some patterns or stripes can be particularly\\nuncomfortable, as found in:\\nText (white background to black printed text or computer screens) \\nHuman-made structures and equipment such as Venetian blinds or escalator stairs (made worse by\\nthe fact they are moving) \\nFabric patterns with contrasting colours such as swirls, stripes or zigzags. \\n \\nFlicker: Even if ﬂicker is consciously noticed, it can still trigger visual stress. Sources of ﬂicker include:\\nLights: Fluorescent, LED, halogen\\nScreens: Computers, televisions, classroom Smart Boards, movie screens, tablets, cellphones \\nMovement of objects in your peripheral vision, such objects outside of what you are directly looking\\nat; pylons or telephone poles on the side of the road; people hovering around your work or study\\nspace\\n \\nGlare from light sources: Glare from reﬂection can often be avoided by moving the angle of the source,\\nhowever, other sources of glare are not so easily reduced, for example:\\nVehicle lights at night \\nReﬂection of lights on wet or polished surfaces  ', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Visual Stress (aka Irlen, Scotopic Sensitivity).pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

There are new LED lighting\\nproducts that allow the user to change the colour of the light using a remote or app on their smart phone.\\n \\nAvoid artiﬁcal light.  If possible, avoid ﬂuorescent lights, which includes compact ﬂuorescent (CFS) bulbs,\\nby turning them oﬀ, or putting in burnt out bulbs. \\n \\nOverlays. Placement of a coloured overlay on the troublesome white page, smart phone, computer screen,\\nor the wearing of coloured lenses, has been found to neutralize the unpleasant visual symptoms (e.g.\\nRobinson and Conway, 2000; Kriss and Evans, 2005). The eﬀective colour varies from person to person.\\n \\nReduce exposure to electronic screens whenever possible.  Considering that the average North\\nAmerican spends several hours a day on recreational screen time, considering limiting the recreational\\nscreen time and replacing it with outdoor or non-electronic activities that are less visually stressful.\\n \\nIf electronic screens must be used, you can:\\nAdjust the screen settings to change the appearance and brightness of background or text. \\nInstall screen tinting software and tint the screen a custom colour \\nPlace an anti-glare overlay in front of the screen\\n \\nLimit exposure to SmartBoards and LCD projectors : SmartBoards and LCD projectors are a type of\\nelectronic screen and can cause discomfort and migraines.

Even though this\\ncan be a frustrating time, there are many things you can do to help while waiting for mental\\nhealth services.\\n1. Keep in Touch With Your Mental Health Service Provider\\nAsk to be put on a cancellation list (if your provider has one). This gives you the possibility of being seen more\\nquickly. If another family cancels an appointment, your service provider calls you to see if your child or teen can\\nmake the appointment time. If not, you can wait for the next availabale appointment.

Let your service provider\\nknow if your child or teen: \\nIs feeling more depressed or anxious; \\nHas more trouble at home or school; \\nExpresses thoughts that life is no longer worth living. \\nCheck out support service s. Many organizations have ‘wait-list supports’, like: \\nMental health information; \\nInformation about support and advocacy groups. \\nKeep your family doctor or pediatrician in the loop. If your child or teen gets worse, he or she may be able to\\nadvocate on your behalf. Your doctor may also know about other available services. \\n \\nKeep a journal. Write about events, situations, behaviours and worries that you want to share with your service\\nprovider. This is a good way to prepare for your ﬁrst appointment. \\n \\nBe ready for the ﬁrst appointment. Make notes of what you want to discuss with the service provider. If you\\nhave kept a journal, this will be much easier. It’s important that your service provider see a progression of how\\nthings have been going.

These services are conﬁdential, and your\\nemployer will not know if or why you contacted EAP. \\n \\nPrivate services. Wait lists are more common for public services like hospital clinics or a children’s mental health\\nagency (this care is covered with your health card). You can make an appointment with a psychologist or social\\nworker in private practice if you can pay the fee yourself (or if you have work beneﬁts that will cover the cost). You\\nmay not have to wait at all to see a professional in private practice. \\n \\nProfessionals in private practice:  (Please see the resource section at the end of this fact sheet to learn\\nhow to ﬁnd a mental health professional)\\n \\nPsychologi sts and p sychological a ssociate s. Clinical psychologists have earned a PhD at university. They are\\nqualiﬁed to assess, diagnose and treat mental health conditions, and focus on talk therapy  (psychological\\ntreatments), but do not prescribe medications. Some universities provide mental health services to their\\ncommunity at a reduced cost, often based on income. To ﬁnd a psychologist anywhere in Canada, visit the\\nCanadian Register of Health Service Psychologists at http://www.crhspp.ca\\n \\nSocial workers: Social workers have a university degree in social work. They do not diagnose mental health\\nconditions, but they can provide counseling and therapy to help you and your family cope with mental health\\nconcerns. \\n \\nCertiﬁed counsellors. In many places, anyone can call themselves a therapist or counsellor without formal\\ntraining. To make sure your counsellor or therapist is truly qualiﬁed, check out the Counselling and  Psychotherapy\\nAssociation (CACP). To ﬁnd a certiﬁed counsellor/therapist in your area, visit the CACP website at\\nhttp://www.ccacc.ca . \\n \\nPsychiatrists. Psychiatrists are medical doctors who have taken several years of extra training in  psychiatry.\\nThey are able to assess, diagnosis and treat mental health conditions (with medications or without). Ask your\\nfamily doctor or pediatrician if they can refer you to a psychiatrist in private practice.  Psychiatrists are covered by\\nyour provincial health plan, and just like seeing any other medical doctor, you do not have to pay ‘out of pocket’\\nfor their services.  \\n3. How to Support Your Child or Teen\\nWarmth and support from parents makes all the diﬀerence in the world to children and youth, though they\\nmay not always show it. Strong family support leads to better outcomes for youth,  whether they have a\\nmental health problem or not. \\n \\nSpend quality, one-on-one time with your child or teen , at least a few times each week.  Quality time can\\nmean just talking or doing an activity together, for at least 15-30 minutes.  Time with just the 2 of you will give\\nyour child or teen the chance to share experiences, feelings  or worries. It will be easier for your teen to open up\\nwhen it’s just the two of you. Focus on  making this a positive experience for both of you. Increasing positive\\ninteractions may help to decrease  negative things, like arguing. \\n \\nInteractive activitie s are be st for creating a strong bond. Watching TV together can be a good place to start\\nif you’re rebuilding your relationship with your child or teen. And it while it can be a positive experience, it doesn’t\\ngive many chances for talking and listening. You can work up to other activities that will give better chances for', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Waiting for Mental Health Services_ What Parents and Caregivers Can Do.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Page 3 / 6\\nconversation. \\n \\nTry things like: \\nCooking or baking together \\nWalking, hiking, going for a bike ride or throwing a ball around \\nBoard or card games (video games don’t really oﬀer good chances for talking) \\nTeaching your child or teen how to do something (knitting, a sport, car repairs, ﬁshing or building) \\nActivities where you have more skill than your children, to help them appreciate that parents are capable,\\nworth looking up to, and a source of help when needed. \\nConnect before correcting. When your child or teen shares feelings, ‘validate’ these feelings by showing that\\nyou’ve heard and care. This helps to make children and youth feel loved and understood. Don’t criticize or\\nminimize his feelings. And try not to jump in with advice-although this is sometimes hard, because we really want\\nto help! Giving  advice when your child is just sharing feelings can make her feel that you really don’t understand.\\nIf she thinks she’s  going to get a lecture every time she shares her feelings, then she won’t conﬁde in you. \\n \\nFor example:\\nTeen: “I’m freaking out-I’m so stressed about all the school work I have to do. I just can’t handle it!” \\nParent: “Sounds like you\\'re feeling a bit overwhelmed by everything you have to do right now... How can I\\nhelp?” \\nLess helpful responses: \\nBlame and advice: “Well, it’s your own fault. You should have done your homework instead of watching TV.”\\n \\nReassurance (without ﬁrst connecting): “You’re worried for nothing! You don’t really have that much to do,\\nyou’ll be ﬁne!”\\nWhat teens usually want most is to be empathy, to be heard and listened to. Reassurance, or advice\\ngiving, even though well intentioned, is no substitute for what most people really want, which is empathy.\\n \\nIf you’re worried about something, state your conce rns with a gentle observation. For example:\\n \\nParent: \\n“I’ve noticed you seem a bit sad lately. I’m worried  about you, how are things going?”\\n\"I\\'m here for you... How do you want me to support you?” \\n“Do you want me to just listen? Or do you want my advice too?”\\nDon’t be di scouraged if you feel that your child or teen is trying to detach from you . Many children and\\nyouth are very focused on their peers. It might even seem that they value their friends and peers more than\\nparents. Children and youth struggling with mental health problems may also try to detach from parents. Try not to\\ntake this personally. Your child or teen still really needs you, even if he isn’t aware of it. While peers are very\\nimportant, they just don’t have the same, long term commitment that a parent or caregiver has. Parents and\\ncaregivers, not peers, will always ‘be there’ in good times and bad, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This is just not\\npossible for peers. Only parents and caregivers can truthfully say, “It’s OK if you’re feeling this way. I’m\\nhere for you and always will be. We’ll get through this together” . Very rarely can peers oﬀer this kind of\\nsupport, because they’re still just growing up themselves. \\n4. Healthy Living Makes a Diﬀerence!\\nNo matter what mental health issue your child is struggling with, caring for the body and mind can really help.\\nTaking care of the basics can go a long way to helping your child or teen to feel better.\\n \\nIf you have a good enough connection with your team, try to model and encourage your teen to: \\nGet enough sleep. Most of us, children and youth included, don’t get enough sleep, and a lack of sleep\\ncan lower mood and energy levels. Better sleep can improve behaviour, attention and outlook.

       " Document(page_content='Page 4 / 6\\nout a regular bedtime, and a calming bedtime ritual. Keep computers, TVs, cell phones and video games out\\nof the bedroom. \\nEat healthy meals and snacks , with plenty of fruits and vegetables. \\nBe physically active. Children and youth need about an hour each day of physical activity, and if this\\nhappens outside, even better. Studies also show that exercise can have antidepressant eﬀects. \\nHave limits on ‘screen time’. Too much screen time doesn’t leave enough time for physical activity or\\n‘face time’ with family and friends. And it can interfere with sleep. Try to set a limit on the amount of time\\neach day your child or teen spends watching TV, using social media or playing video games. Please don’t try\\nto ‘ban’ anything-this could start a small war. Have a discussion with your child or teen about setting\\nreasonable limits that everyone can live with. \\nTake care of your self too. Waiting for mental health services can be stressful. Make sure you’re eating\\nwell, getting enough sleep and exercise too. The best way to get your children to take care of themselves, is\\nfor you to model healthy behaviours. \\n5. Help Your Child or Teen Cope With Stress\\nStress is part of our daily lives. Mental health problems like depression or anxiety can make it harder to handle\\nthese everyday stresses. Learning to cope with stress in a positive way is an important part of mental health.\\n \\nHelp your child or teen to: \\nGet support (especially from you!). Remind your child or teen that you are always there for support during\\nrough times. Listen and validate your child’s feelings. Ask your child or teen how she’d like to be supported. \\n \\nIdentify sources of stress. Children and youth often feel stressed by: \\nSchool (teachers, schoolwork); \\nFriends and peers (sometimes bullying); \\nParents and siblings (family conﬂicts, ﬁnancial troubles, separation, divorce, family illnesses). \\n \\nFind ways to  cope with tho se stresses. There are many ways to handle stress in a positive way such as: \\nDistraction (moving attention away from the stress for a little while) \\nTaking a walk, \\nExercising \\nListening to music \\nDoing something enjoyable \\nRelaxation and Mindfulness \\nConsciously relaxing muscles and focusing on breathing deeply. Calming the mind by trying to\\nlet go of thoughts and focusing on the moment. \\nYoga practice-focusing on body postures and breathing.\\n \\nTry to deal with the problem that is causing the stress. This can mean facing the stress and making a\\nplan to deal with it. If school work is a stress, this could mean getting tutoring, help to organize work or\\nchecking for learning disabilities. If the problem is conﬂict, listen carefully to your child or teen’s point of\\nview. Your can then help your child develop a plan to resolve it. You can also help your child to\\ncommunicate assertively. If the conﬂict is with you, set the example for listening and positive\\ncommunication, and try to come up with a solution that works for everyone. If you’re having trouble with\\nfamily conﬂict, family therapy may help. \\n6. Take Care of Yourself \\nAs a parent, it’s hard to ﬁnd time for yourself when you are busy looking after your children. But it’s also much\\nharder to meet your child’s mental health needs, if your own mental or physical health needs are not met. \\n \\nTake care of yourself by: \\nAsking family and friend s for help and support. It’s much easier to cope if you have support from', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Waiting for Mental Health Services_ What Parents and Caregivers Can Do.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

It can be diﬃcult\\nand even scary at times. The good news, is that there are many things that the health\\nprofessionals (like doctors) can do in order to help your sibling get better. There are also many\\nthings that you can do to help as well.\\nIntroduction\\n\"When my sister got sick she was acting really bizarre and the police had to take her to emergency. It was really\\nscary. My friends didn\\'t understand at ﬁrst that it was just because her brain was sick, but they do now.\"\\nWhy is my brother or sister acting this way?\\nPsychosis is an illness of the brain. It is caused in part by genetic (inherited) brain problems plus stress or street\\ndrugs like marijuana and crystal meth. When the brain gets ill, it is hard for the person to know what is wrong.\\nThey may make up and believe other explanations for why they feel so weird, and they may act strangely. It will be\\nreally hard for them to tell the diﬀerence between what is real and not real. Psychosis can be treated, and the\\nearlier it is treated, the easier their recovery is likely to be.\\nWill I get it too?\\nThe risk for psychosis is about three in every hundred people. If you have a sister or brother with psychosis your\\nrisk of getting it is one in ten. You have way more chance of NOT getting psychosis than of getting it. However, if\\nsometime in the future you think you might be getting ill you can go to your family doctor for a checkup. It is also a\\nreally, really good idea to avoid using street drugs like marijuana and crystal meth, which put stress on the parts of\\nthe brain that are involved in psychosis. If there is an early psychosis service in your area, the people there can\\nalso talk to you and answer any questions you have. They might be able to put you in touch with some other\\nsiblings of people with psychosis to talk to, as well.\\nWas it something I did?\\nPsychosis is a medical illness. Sometimes when something hard happens in your life or to your family, people deal\\nwith it by blaming themselves. You don\\'t need to. There\\'s nothing you could have done to cause your brother or\\nsister\\'s illness.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/When Your Brother or Sister Has Psychosis_ Information for Youth.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Doing one-on-one things with your brother or sister will be\\nbetter than doing things in crowds. They're likely to be giving themselves a hard time about their illness. You can\\nhelp by being encouraging and reminding them it's illness and they will get better.\\nHow long will it take for them to get better?\\nNowadays, psychosis is normally treated with low doses of antipsychotic medication along with education and\\nsupport for the person and their family. Once they start treatment, it can take a few months to up to a year for the\\nperson to get better. Sometimes they'll have some leftover symptoms that hang on longer. While they're\\nrecovering, they're likely to have a lot less energy to do things, be a lot quieter, need a lot more alone time, and\\nprefer not to be in large crowds or noisy places.\\nAcknowledgements\\n \\nSpecial thanks to HereToHelpBC  for permission to reproduce this article.\", metadata={'source': './content/docs/When Your Brother or Sister Has Psychosis_ Information for Youth.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

They include service animals\\n(typically a dog that helps others), as well as therapy animals (“emotional support animal”).\\nWhat is a Working Animal?\\nWorking animals help people in their day-to-day lives.\\nThere are diﬀerent types of working animals:\\n1. Service\\nanimal:A service animal, which is usually a dog, is an animal that has been trained to help a person with a\\nphysical disability, brain condition, and/or mental health challenge. Service dogs can be trained to help\\ntheir handler with speciﬁc tasks so that their handler can be more independent in their day-to-day lives.\\nService dogs carry special protections in the law, e.g. they can have access to places that other animals\\nare not allowed to access.\\nMost service animals are dogs:\\n• Guide dogs: trained to guide people who are blind or have a hard time seeing. to see.\\n• Hearing dogs: trained to alert a deaf or hard of hearing person to sounds like ﬁre alarms.\\n• Service or mobility dogs: trained to make life easier by opening doors, ringing doorbells and, carrying\\nitems for people.\\n• Seizure dogs: trained to alert to an oncoming seizure, stand guard or get help\\n• Psychiatric service dogs: trained to ease distress, get medication, activate medical alerts, lead the\\nowner away from crowds etc.\\n2. Therapy\\nanimal:A therapy animal (aka. “emotional support animal”) is an animal that has been trained to provide\\naﬀection, comfort and support to people. Unlike a service animal, a therapy animal has been trained to\\ninteract with diﬀerent people, not just the handler.\\nTerms\\n“Assistance animals”\\nThe term “assistance animals” is a term used internationally, and means the same thing as “service\\nanimal”.\\nIn North America the main term used is “service animals”, such as “service dogs”.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Working Animals (including Service Dogs).pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Do give them space. Do give them privacy, by NOT staring, and by NOT\\nasking them about their disability.\\nDon’t\\nDon’t distract the dog by petting, or talking to it.\\nI’d like to get a Service Dog\\nIf you think a service dog could help you or your child, it\\'s important to understand the diﬀerent types of working\\nanimals and decide which is best for you, your lifestyle and your needs.\\nFor example:\\nDo you want a dog to keep you company during diﬃcult times? Talk to your health-care provider about an\\nemotional support dog.\\nDo you need a dog to help you perform day-to-day tasks in your home? Consider a service dog.\\nHow Can I Get a Service Dog in Ontario?\\nSpeak with your health-care provider and ask them to draft a letter indicating the medical need for a service\\ndog — many training organizations will ask for a physician referral as part of their application process\\nDo some research into reputable training agencies.

After you ﬁnd a reputable agency, there will be application forms to ﬁll out, and due to\\nthe high demand for service animals, you can expect to be placed on a wait list.

On the other hand, many people do their own\\ndogs and such dogs are called “owner-trained”. They are recognized in Ontario since the law only calls for a health\\ncare provider letter explaining that their patient has a disability and needs their dogs with them at all times.\\nHowever, these dogs are often considered \"in training\" their whole lives. Not all dogs make good service dogs -\\neven if their owner has a disability.\\nTo be a service dog, a dog should:\\nShow no aggressive behaviors at all time,\\nBe trained to go to the bathroom on command,\\nAnswer all basic commands\\nBe trained to answer their owner\\'s needs in respect to their disability.', metadata={'source': './content/docs/Working Animals (including Service Dogs).pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Not all dogs who are pets can be trained for task-speciﬁc roles, nor\\ndo they have the temperament to be in that role.\\nUnderstanding the Laws in Ontario\\nIf you\\'re considering getting a service animal, it\\'s important to familiarize yourself with Ontario provincial laws such\\nas:\\nBill 80, Ontario Service Dog Act - an act respecting the rights of people in Ontario who use service dogs1.\\nAccessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) - an act stating everyone who serves the public must2.\\nwelcome service animals\\nRegistering a Service Animal\\nOnce your service dog has been trained, training agencies will give you documentation or an ID card to show they\\nare trained as a service animal. However, in Ontario there isn\\'t a standardized registration program for service\\ndogs. This will likely change in the near future to make it easier for handlers.\\nEven if your dog is wearing a service harness, restaurants, hotels and other service providers may ask for \"proof\"\\nyour dog is a service dog.

Instead of being hard on ourselves about it, we\\ncan accept that this has been an unprecedented time. Given that there is going to be increased\\nscreen time, we can actively nudge our children’s technology use to 1) favor healthy and\\nproductive screen time use, while 2) discouraging less healthy and less productive screen time.\\nDave’s Story: “He has a meltdown when we tell him screen time is over.”\\nNormally, Dave is a calm yet active child who enjoys getting outside and playing with his friends. Since the\\npandemic however, there has been less time with friends, and lately, he has been using more screen time.\\nUnfortunately, when his time is up, he is now having meltdowns and refuses to give up the screens.\\nParents are at a loss -- What should parents do?\\nIntroduction\\nPrior to the COVID pandemic lockdown in spring 2020:\\nMany parents had concerns that some kids were spending too much time in front of a screen;\\nAccording to one survey, most parents (77%) said they enforced household rules about screen time and the\\nuse of technology as of February 2020.\\nPrior to COVID, guidelines on scream time recommended:\\nFor children aged < 1 → No time on digital devices.\\nFor children aged <5 → 1-hr or less per day on digital devices\\nChildren age 6-18 → Max 1-2 hrs/ day on recreational screens\\nPre-COVID Screen Time Guidelines\\nAge Screen Time [1] Physical Activity (2) Nature Time (3,4)\\nAge 0-1 None Several times /day', metadata={'source': './content/docs/“COVID Screen Time”, aka Screen Time Since the Pandemic_ Information for Parents and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

A Montreal study (2019) showed that children and adults do best with mental health and\\noverall health when they use less than 2-hrs/day of recreational screen time. \\n> 30-minutes of social media use is associated with more depressive symptoms (Hunt et al., 2018).\\nExcessive screen time is linked to less nature time\\nStudies show however, that children/youth need at least 10-hrs /week outside in nature, in order to\\nhave optimal development of their eyes, in order to prevent myopia.\\nWhile some children / youth will be able to self-regulate their use, others will require more active\\nintervention from parents.\\nWithout active intervention, some children and youth are vulnerable to screen addiction, which is deﬁned as\\nexcessive use to the point where it crowds out healthier activities (such as sleep) and/or causes problems\\nwith home, school (or work). Issues which can make a child/youth more vulnerable include having conditions\\nsuch as:\\nAttention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),\\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD),', metadata={'source': './content/docs/“COVID Screen Time”, aka Screen Time Since the Pandemic_ Information for Parents and Caregivers.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
