Vancouver-based counsellor and stand-up comic David Granirer, and his newly trained group of Ottawa-based Stand Up For Mental Health comics, are going to prove you wrong.Granirer, who himself suffers from depression, runs Stand Up For Mental Health (SMH), a program that teaches stand-up comedy to people with mental illness. Featured in the Voice Award winning, CBC documentary, Cracking Up, SMH helps participants build self-esteem and fight the public stigma around mental illness. Thanks to a grant from Canada Post, Granirer has worked with 10 Ottawa residents who are now ready to share their mental health experiences, with laughter and special insight.The group will perform their inaugural show on Friday, May 8 at the Bronson Centre (211 Bronson Ave). Tickets are $5.00 if you admit you're crazy, $10.00 if you don't. Tickets are available from Psychiatric Survivors of Ottawa (613.567.4379) or Collected Works Book Store (613.722.1265)."Since choosing Mental Health as our Cause of Choice almost three years ago, we've heard incredible stories of hope and empowerment," said Janie Randolph, Director of Canada Post's Cause of Choice. "Being part of this innovative program that helps people recover and also spreads such a powerful message, is an honour. On behalf of everyone at Canada Post, I wish David and this great group of comedians incredible success!"The comics were recruited by Psychiatric Survivors of Ottawa (PSO), a peer support organization, which is partnering with SMH to put on the event. "This is a great way to change the public's perception of what it means to have mental health issues," says Sonja Cronkhite a co-ordinator at PSO. "When it comes to mental illness, people are often too ashamed to seek treatment. Stand Up For Mental Health provides a great way of fighting the shame and making it okay to reach out and get help," Cronkhite adds.This message is spreading.

The FRIENDS program helps children and youth cope with feelings of fear, worry, and depression by building resilience and self-esteem and teaching cognitive and emotional skills in a simple, well-structured format. FRIENDS is a unique empirically validated approach with an extensive evidence base and a wealth of real-world experience from successful large scale implementations across a variety of cultural and socio-economic groups. This research and practical experience in thousands of classrooms and clinics across the world has shown that exposing anxious children to a complete 10-session FRIENDS program can reduce their risk of developing a disorder for up to 6 years, while children with normal levels of worry benefit by acquiring resilience and skills for managing daily stressors. FRIENDS can be delivered by teachers in the classroom as a universal prevention program or by guidance and mental health professionals as an as an early intervention to children who may be at higher risk for anxiety disorders.

The FRIENDS program helps children and youth cope with feelings of fear, worry, and depression by building resilience and self-esteem and teaching cognitive and emotional skills in a simple, well-structured format. FRIENDS is a unique empirically validated approach with an extensive evidence base and a wealth of real-world experience from successful large scale implementations across a variety of cultural and socio-economic groups. This research and practical experience in thousands of classrooms and clinics across the world has shown that exposing anxious children to a complete 10-session FRIENDS program can reduce their risk of developing a disorder for up to 6 years, while children with normal levels of worry benefit by acquiring resilience and skills for managing daily stressors. FRIENDS can be delivered by teachers in the classroom as a universal prevention program or by guidance and mental health professionals as an as an early intervention to children who may be at higher risk for anxiety disorders.

&nbsp;
Takes place Fri, Sep 19, 2008 at 9 AM to 5 PM, at the RA Centre, Canada Room.
&nbsp;
This year we have the good fortune to have Dr. Clare Pain return to the Capital to share her knowledge and experience in her work with the impact of trauma.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Dr. Pain will help us understand the concept of &lsquo;Mentalization' as a focus in treating individuals who have suffered trauma. While the use of the term &lsquo;mentalizing' may appear new to many therapists, it is essentially a manner by which one perceives and interprets one's world. However, when one's cognitive, psychological and emotional development has been interrupted by traumatic experiences, the capacity to accurately process one's inner life or interact with others is often severely impaired.
&nbsp;
Dr. Pain will share her rich experience in using this concept to assist clients to understand and process their traumatic history and to arrive at a more integrated and internalized capacity for self-regulation and self-awareness.
&nbsp;
Take this opportunity to join us to share your experience, discuss challenging client issues and improve your own mentalizing capacity.
&nbsp;
We look forward to seeing many of you who have attended our conferences in the past, as well as meeting first timers.

The group is structured and follows the "Anxiety, Panic, and Avoidance Behaviour-Mangement Workbook" created by ADAO. The goal of the workshop is to help participants develop:

Knowledge about anxiety conditions
An understanding of the impact of nutrition and stress on symptoms of anxiety
Self-management techniques including deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness techniques
An understanding of how automatic thoughts, unconscious rules / beliefs, and thinking styles contribute to anxiety
Effective communication skills
The ability to use graduated exposure to reduce symptoms of anxiety
Goal setting and follow-through
Positive coping strategies to replace negative coping strategies
Assertiveness skills (e.g., setting boundaries, constructive criticism)
Anger management techniques


The ADAO 14-Week Anxiety, Panic, and Avoidance Behaviour Management program is a structured educational workshop, the focus of which is on providing participants with tools and information to assist them in managing their symptoms of anxiety. Each week, following a check-in activity, facilitators will guide participants through a relaxation exercise. The focus of each session will be on information-sharing; however, the format will vary from week (e.g., group/individual activities, mini-lectures, role play exercises).Each session ends with a grounding exercise as well as a check-out activity. Facilitators are provided with session agendas, background reading material, presentation material, relaxation/grounding exercises, as well as participant handouts for each session. Each session is also supplemented with a gratitude journal exercise, resource-sharing, as well as a focus on connecting participants to the community.During the first session, participants are introduced to anxiety, the different types, and its causes. Subsequent sessions focus on relaxation and related techniques; nutrition and physical exercise; mindfulness; and an introduction to the process of identifying and distinguishing between thoughts and feelings. Over the course of four weeks, participants are introduced to cognitive-behaviour theory and techniques (e.g., automatic thoughts, Socratic method, cognitive distortions, assumptions and core beliefs) as well as graduated exposure, introducing participants to both the theory behind these ideas as well as the tools used to manage related symptoms of anxiety.Sessions are also dedicated to providing participants with information and strategies to manage feelings and emotions and two weeks of classes are dedicated to issues related to anger and assertiveness. The two final classes focus on anxiety and spirituality as well as a celebration of the progress made over the course of the 14-weeks.Participants are provided with a copy of "The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook, 4th Edition" (Edmund J.

Explosive/noncompliant children and adolescents exhibit intense temper outbursts, oppositionality, and verbal and physical aggression. These behaviors have extremely adverse effects on family life and functioning at school.&nbsp;Research has shown that such children may also be diagnosed with various psychiatric disorders. Conventional reward and punishment approaches to treatment have been shown to be useful in the treatment of many explosive/noncompliant children and adolescents. However, such approaches have also been found to be ineffective for a substantial percentage of such youth.

Dr. Greene provides an alternative conceptualization of the difficulties of these children and adolescents; namely, that their difficulties are a byproduct of lacking cognitive skills in the domains of flexibility/adaptability, frustration tolerance, and problem-solving. Based on this conceptualization, he provides an overview of a model of treatment called Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS), first articulated in his acclaimed book, The Explosive Child.

ANXIETY DISORDERS are now recognized as the most common, chronic and costly emotional conditions encountered in healthcare settings. The soaring trend towards anxiety has been accelerated by global stress and high-profile threats, such as terrorism, school violence, child kidnappings, and other dangers. The increasing rate of traumas to children, which also include divorce, family breakdown, violence in society and the media, and a failing school system, has produced a &ldquo;shell shocked&rdquo; generation suffering from anxiety in many cases. Our challenge is to recognize anxiety in children and help them cope.
&nbsp;
This workshop presents a model for how and why anxiety develops in children and adolescents, and provides practical assessment and treatment strategies that can be applied immediately by healthcare professionals in their various settings. Seven key anxiety disorders will be addressed with case examples: separation anxiety disorder, panic disorder, overanxious disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, phobias, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Emphasis will be on creative psychotherapeutic interventions involving insight-oriented, cognitive-behavioral, biological, spiritual, and family systems approaches.

Knowledge about anxiety conditions 
An understanding of the impact of nutrition and stress on symptoms of anxiety 
Self-management techniques including deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness techniques 
An understanding of how automatic thoughts, unconscious rules / beliefs, and thinking styles contribute to anxiety 
Effective communication skills 
The ability to use graduated exposure to reduce symptoms of anxiety 
Goal setting and follow-through 
Positive coping strategies to replace negative coping strategies 
Assertiveness skills (e.g., setting boundaries, constructive criticism) 
Anger management techniques 


The ADAO 14-Week Anxiety, Panic, and Avoidance Behaviour Management program is a structured educational workshop, the focus of which is on providing participants with tools and information to assist them in managing their symptoms of anxiety. Each week, following a check-in activity, facilitators will guide participants through a relaxation exercise. The focus of each session will be on information-sharing; however, the format will vary from week (e.g., group/individual activities, mini-lectures, role play exercises).Each session ends with a grounding exercise as well as a check-out activity. Facilitators are provided with session agendas, background reading material, presentation material, relaxation/grounding exercises, as well as participant handouts for each session. Each session is also supplemented with a gratitude journal exercise, resource-sharing, as well as a focus on connecting participants to the community.During the first session, participants are introduced to anxiety, the different types, and its causes. Subsequent sessions focus on relaxation and related techniques; nutrition and physical exercise; mindfulness; and an introduction to the process of identifying and distinguishing between thoughts and feelings. Over the course of four weeks, participants are introduced to cognitive-behaviour theory and techniques (e.g., automatic thoughts, Socratic method, cognitive distortions, assumptions and core beliefs) as well as graduated exposure, introducing participants to both the theory behind these ideas as well as the tools used to manage related symptoms of anxiety.Sessions are also dedicated to providing participants with information and strategies to manage feelings and emotions and two weeks of classes are dedicated to issues related to anger and assertiveness. The two final classes focus on anxiety and spirituality as well as a celebration of the progress made over the course of the 14-weeks.Participants are provided with a copy of "The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook, 4th Edition" (Edmund J. Bourne), a copy of "Mind Over Mood" (Christine Padesky with Dennis Greenberger) as well as a Participant manual, which is produced by ADAO.

The educational workshop is a closed group, which means the same individuals meet every week. The group is structured and follows the "Anxiety, Panic, and Avoidance Behaviour-Mangement Workbook" created by ADAO. The goal of the workshop is to help participants develop:

Knowledge about anxiety conditions 
An understanding of the impact of nutrition and stress on symptoms of anxiety 
Self-management techniques including deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness techniques 
An understanding of how automatic thoughts, unconscious rules / beliefs, and thinking styles contribute to anxiety 
Effective communication skills 
The ability to use graduated exposure to reduce symptoms of anxiety 
Goal setting and follow-through 
Positive coping strategies to replace negative coping strategies 
Assertiveness skills (e.g., setting boundaries, constructive criticism) 
Anger management techniques 

The ADAO 14-Week Anxiety, Panic, and Avoidance Behaviour Management program is a structured educational workshop, the focus of which is on providing participants with tools and information to assist them in managing their symptoms of anxiety. Each week, following a check-in activity, facilitators will guide participants through a relaxation exercise. The focus of each session will be on information-sharing; however, the format will vary from week (e.g., group/individual activities, mini-lectures, role play exercises).
Each session ends with a grounding exercise as well as a check-out activity. Facilitators are provided with session agendas, background reading material, presentation material, relaxation/grounding exercises, as well as participant handouts for each session. Each session is also supplemented with a gratitude journal exercise, resource-sharing, as well as a focus on connecting participants to the community.
During the first session, participants are introduced to anxiety, the different types, and its causes. Subsequent sessions focus on relaxation and related techniques; nutrition and physical exercise; mindfulness; and an introduction to the process of identifying and distinguishing between thoughts and feelings. Over the course of four weeks, participants are introduced to cognitive-behaviour theory and techniques (e.g., automatic thoughts, Socratic method, cognitive distortions, assumptions and core beliefs) as well as graduated exposure, introducing participants to both the theory behind these ideas as well as the tools used to manage related symptoms of anxiety.Sessions are also dedicated to providing participants with information and strategies to manage feelings and emotions and two weeks of classes are dedicated to issues related to anger and assertiveness. The two final classes focus on anxiety and spirituality as well as a celebration of the progress made over the course of the 14-weeks.Participants are provided with a copy of "The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook, 4th Edition" (Edmund J. Bourne), a copy of "Mind Over Mood" (Christine Padesky with Dennis Greenberger) as well as a Participant manual, which is produced by ADAO.

The ADAO 14-Week Anxiety, Panic, and Avoidance Behaviour Management program is a structured educational workshop, the focus of which is on providing participants with tools and information to assist them in managing their symptoms of anxiety.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Each week, following a check-in activity, facilitators will guide participants through a relaxation exercise.&nbsp; The focus of each session will be on information-sharing; however, the format will vary from week (e.g., group/individual activities, mini-lectures, role play exercises).&nbsp; Each session ends with a grounding exercise as well as a check-out activity.&nbsp; Facilitators are provided with session agendas, background reading material, presentation material, relaxation/grounding exercises, as well as participant handouts for each session.&nbsp; Each session is also supplemented with a gratitude journal exercise, resource-sharing, as well as a focus on connecting participants to the community.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
During the first session, participants are introduced to anxiety, the different types, and its causes.&nbsp; Subsequent sessions focus on relaxation and related techniques; nutrition and physical exercise; mindfulness; and an introduction to the process of identifying and distinguishing between thoughts and feelings.&nbsp; Over the course of four weeks, participants are introduced to cognitive-behaviour theory and techniques (e.g., automatic thoughts, Socratic method, cognitive distortions, assumptions and core beliefs) as well as graduated exposure, introducing participants to both the theory behind these ideas as well as the tools used to manage related symptoms of anxiety.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Sessions are also dedicated to providing participants with information and strategies to manage feelings and emotions and two weeks of classes are dedicated to issues related to anger and assertiveness.&nbsp; The two final classes focus on anxiety and spirituality as well as a celebration of the progress made over the course of the 14-weeks.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Upon graduation from the program, the expectation is that participants have achieved short-term goals related to the reduction of anxiety symptoms (i.e., I'll pick up the groceries with my husband each week; I'll attend a social event twice a week).&nbsp; Further, the root causes of anxiety (i.e., anxiety-provoking thinking styles) have been explored and the process of self-management taught.&nbsp; Participants in the program are expected to develop:

Knowledge about anxiety conditions
An understanding of the impact of nutrition and stress on symptoms of anxiety
Self-management techniques including deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness techniques
An understanding of how automatic thoughts, unconscious rules / beliefs, and thinking styles contribute to anxiety
Effective communication skills
The ability to use graduated exposure to reduce symptoms of anxiety
Goal setting and follow-through
Positive coping strategies to replace negative coping strategies
Assertiveness skills (i.e., setting boundaries, constructive criticism)
Anger management techniques
An ability to cope with setbacks and plateaus 

Participants are expected to have begun the process of re-integrating into previous activities (i.e., employment, school, social, family, and recreational).&nbsp; The program indirectly benefits the household members of the individuals who participate in the program, as they are often affected negatively by an anxiety sufferer's symptoms.
Participants are provided with a copy of "The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook, 4th Edition" (Edmund J. Bourne), a copy of "Mind Over Mood" (Christine Padesky with Dennis Greenberger) as well as a Participant manual, which is produced by ADAO. The manual contains additional reading material as well as an agenda and outline for each session.&nbsp;

The ADAO 14-Week Anxiety Management Workshop is a structured educational workshop, the focus of which is on providing participants with tools and information to assist them in managing their symptoms of anxiety.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Each week, following a check-in activity, facilitators will guide participants through a relaxation exercise.&nbsp; The focus of each session will be on information-sharing; however, the format will vary from week (e.g., group/individual activities, mini-lectures, role play exercises).&nbsp; Each session ends with a grounding exercise as well as a check-out activity.&nbsp; Facilitators are provided with session agendas, background reading material, presentation material, relaxation/grounding exercises, as well as participant handouts for each session.&nbsp; Each session is also supplemented with a gratitude journal exercise, resource-sharing, as well as a focus on connecting participants to the community.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
During the first session, participants are introduced to anxiety, the different types, and its causes.&nbsp; Subsequent sessions focus on relaxation and related techniques; nutrition and physical exercise; mindfulness; and an introduction to the process of identifying and distinguishing between thoughts and feelings.&nbsp; Over the course of four weeks, participants are introduced to cognitive-behaviour theory and techniques (e.g., automatic thoughts, Socratic method, cognitive distortions, assumptions and core beliefs) as well as graduated exposure, introducing participants to both the theory behind these ideas as well as the tools used to manage related symptoms of anxiety.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Sessions are also dedicated to providing participants with information and strategies to manage feelings and emotions and two weeks of classes are dedicated to issues related to anger and assertiveness.&nbsp; The two final classes focus on anxiety and spirituality as well as a celebration of the progress made over the course of the 14-weeks.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Upon graduation from the program, the expectation is that participants have achieved short-term goals related to the reduction of anxiety symptoms (i.e., I'll pick up the groceries with my husband each week; I'll attend a social event twice a week).&nbsp; Further, the root causes of anxiety (i.e., anxiety-provoking thinking styles) have been explored and the process of self-management taught.&nbsp; Participants in the program are expected to develop:

Knowledge about anxiety conditions
An understanding of the impact of nutrition and stress on symptoms of anxiety
Self-management techniques including deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness techniques
An understanding of how automatic thoughts, unconscious rules / beliefs, and thinking styles contribute to anxiety
Effective communication skills
The ability to use graduated exposure to reduce symptoms of anxiety
Goal setting and follow-through
Positive coping strategies to replace negative coping strategies
Assertiveness skills (i.e., setting boundaries, constructive criticism)
Anger management techniques
An ability to cope with setbacks and plateaus 

Participants are expected to have begun the process of re-integrating into previous activities (i.e., employment, school, social, family, and recreational).&nbsp; The program indirectly benefits the household members of the individuals who participate in the program, as they are often affected negatively by an anxiety sufferer's symptoms.
Participants are provided with a copy of "The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook, 4th Edition" (Edmund J. Bourne), a copy of "Mind Over Mood" (Christine Padesky with Dennis Greenberger) as well as a Participant manual, which is produced by ADAO. The manual contains additional reading material as well as an agenda and outline for each session.&nbsp;

14 Week Anxiety Management Workshop
&nbsp;
The ADAO 14-Week Anxiety Management Workshop is a structured educational group workshop, the focus of which is on providing participants with tools and information to assist them in managing their symptoms of anxiety.&nbsp; The workshop is held once a week, for 2 and a half hours in the evening, for the duration of fourteen weeks. The location is downtown Ottawa. The workshop fee is $ 425.00.
&nbsp;
Each week, following a check-in activity, facilitators will guide participants through a relaxation exercise.&nbsp; The focus of each session will be on information-sharing; however, the format will vary from week (e.g., group/individual activities, mini-lectures, role play exercises).&nbsp; Each session ends with a grounding exercise as well as a check-out activity.&nbsp; Facilitators are provided with session agendas, background reading material, presentation material, relaxation/grounding exercises, as well as participant handouts for each session.&nbsp; Each session is also supplemented with a gratitude journal exercise, resource-sharing, as well as a focus on connecting participants to the community.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
During the first session, participants are introduced to anxiety, the different types, and its causes.&nbsp; Subsequent sessions focus on relaxation and related techniques; nutrition and physical exercise; mindfulness; and an introduction to the process of identifying and distinguishing between thoughts and feelings.&nbsp; Over the course of four weeks, participants are introduced to cognitive-behaviour theory and techniques (e.g., automatic thoughts, Socratic method, cognitive distortions, assumptions and core beliefs) as well as graduated exposure, introducing participants to both the theory behind these ideas as well as the tools used to manage related symptoms of anxiety.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Sessions are also dedicated to providing participants with information and strategies to manage feelings and emotions and two weeks of classes are dedicated to issues related to anger and assertiveness.&nbsp; The two final classes focus on anxiety and spirituality as well as a celebration of the progress made over the course of the 14-weeks.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Upon graduation from the program, the expectation is that participants have achieved short-term goals related to the reduction of anxiety symptoms (i.e., I'll pick up the groceries with my husband each week; I'll attend a social event twice a week).&nbsp; Further, the root causes of anxiety (i.e., anxiety-provoking thinking styles) have been explored and the process of self-management taught.&nbsp; Participants in the program are expected to develop:

Knowledge about anxiety conditions
An understanding of the impact of nutrition and stress on symptoms of anxiety
Self-management techniques including deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness techniques
An understanding of how automatic thoughts, unconscious rules / beliefs, and thinking styles contribute to anxiety
Effective communication skills
The ability to use graduated exposure to reduce symptoms of anxiety
Goal setting and follow-through
Positive coping strategies to replace negative coping strategies
Assertiveness skills (i.e., setting boundaries, constructive criticism)
Anger management techniques
An ability to cope with setbacks and plateaus 

Participants are expected to have begun the process of re-integrating into previous activities (i.e., employment, school, social, family, and recreational).&nbsp; The program indirectly benefits the household members of the individuals who participate in the program, as they are often affected negatively by an anxiety sufferer's symptoms.
Participants are provided with a copy of "The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook, 4th Edition" (Edmund J. Bourne), a copy of "Mind Over Mood" (Christine Padesky with Dennis Greenberger) as well as a Participant manual, which is produced by ADAO. The manual contains additional reading material as well as an agenda and outline for each session.&nbsp;",,NULL,,"["en"]",,45.4310980,-75.6809500,,NULL,9120,event,NULL,www.anxietydisordersontario.ca,"{"name":{"en":"14 Week Anxiety Management Workshop","fr":""},"description":{"en":"&nbsp;\r\n14 Week Anxiety Management Workshop\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe ADAO 14-Week Anxiety Management Workshop is a structured educational group workshop, the focus of which is on providing participants with tools and information to assist them in managing their symptoms of anxiety.&nbsp; The workshop is held once a week, for 2 and a half hours in the evening, for the duration of fourteen weeks.

The ADAO 14-Week Anxiety Management Workshop is a structured educational workshop, the focus of which is on providing participants with tools and information to assist them in managing their symptoms of anxiety.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Each week, following a check-in activity, facilitators will guide participants through a relaxation exercise.&nbsp; The focus of each session will be on information-sharing; however, the format will vary from week (e.g., group/individual activities, mini-lectures, role play exercises).&nbsp; Each session ends with a grounding exercise as well as a check-out activity.&nbsp; Facilitators are provided with session agendas, background reading material, presentation material, relaxation/grounding exercises, as well as participant handouts for each session.&nbsp; Each session is also supplemented with a gratitude journal exercise, resource-sharing, as well as a focus on connecting participants to the community.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
During the first session, participants are introduced to anxiety, the different types, and its causes.&nbsp; Subsequent sessions focus on relaxation and related techniques; nutrition and physical exercise; mindfulness; and an introduction to the process of identifying and distinguishing between thoughts and feelings.&nbsp; Over the course of four weeks, participants are introduced to cognitive-behaviour theory and techniques (e.g., automatic thoughts, Socratic method, cognitive distortions, assumptions and core beliefs) as well as graduated exposure, introducing participants to both the theory behind these ideas as well as the tools used to manage related symptoms of anxiety.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Sessions are also dedicated to providing participants with information and strategies to manage feelings and emotions and two weeks of classes are dedicated to issues related to anger and assertiveness.&nbsp; The two final classes focus on anxiety and spirituality as well as a celebration of the progress made over the course of the 14-weeks.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Upon graduation from the program, the expectation is that participants have achieved short-term goals related to the reduction of anxiety symptoms (i.e., I'll pick up the groceries with my husband each week; I'll attend a social event twice a week).&nbsp; Further, the root causes of anxiety (i.e., anxiety-provoking thinking styles) have been explored and the process of self-management taught.&nbsp; Participants in the program are expected to develop:

Knowledge about anxiety conditions
An understanding of the impact of nutrition and stress on symptoms of anxiety
Self-management techniques including deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness techniques
An understanding of how automatic thoughts, unconscious rules / beliefs, and thinking styles contribute to anxiety
Effective communication skills
The ability to use graduated exposure to reduce symptoms of anxiety
Goal setting and follow-through
Positive coping strategies to replace negative coping strategies
Assertiveness skills (i.e., setting boundaries, constructive criticism)
Anger management techniques
An ability to cope with setbacks and plateaus 

Participants are expected to have begun the process of re-integrating into previous activities (i.e., employment, school, social, family, and recreational).&nbsp; The program indirectly benefits the household members of the individuals who participate in the program, as they are often affected negatively by an anxiety sufferer's symptoms.
Participants are provided with a copy of "The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook, 4th Edition" (Edmund J. Bourne), a copy of "Mind Over Mood" (Christine Padesky with Dennis Greenberger) as well as a Participant manual, which is produced by ADAO. The manual contains additional reading material as well as an agenda and outline for each session.

Each week, following a check-in activity, facilitators will guide participants through a relaxation exercise.  The focus of each session will be on information-sharing; however, the format will vary from week (e.g., group/individual activities, mini-lectures, role play exercises).  Each session ends with a grounding exercise as well as a check-out activity.  Facilitators are provided with session agendas, background reading material, presentation material, relaxation/grounding exercises, as well as participant handouts for each session.  Each session is also supplemented with a gratitude journal exercise, resource-sharing, as well as a focus on connecting participants to the community.
During the first session, participants are introduced to anxiety, the different types, and its causes.  Subsequent sessions focus on relaxation and related techniques; nutrition and physical exercise; mindfulness; and an introduction to the process of identifying and distinguishing between thoughts and feelings.  Over the course of four weeks, participants are introduced to cognitive-behaviour theory and techniques (e.g., automatic thoughts, Socratic method, cognitive distortions, assumptions and core beliefs) as well as graduated exposure, introducing participants to both the theory behind these ideas as well as the tools used to manage related symptoms of anxiety.
Sessions are also dedicated to providing participants with information and strategies to manage feelings and emotions and two weeks of classes are dedicated to issues related to anger and assertiveness.  The two final classes focus on anxiety and spirituality as well as a celebration of the progress made over the course of the 14-weeks.
Upon graduation from the program, the expectation is that participants have achieved short-term goals related to the reduction of anxiety symptoms (i.e., I'll pick up the groceries with my husband each week; I'll attend a social event twice a week).  Further, the root causes of anxiety (i.e., anxiety-provoking thinking styles) have been explored and the process of self-management taught.  Participants in the program are expected to develop:&bull;	Knowledge about anxiety conditions&bull;	An understanding of the impact of nutrition and stress on symptoms of anxiety&bull;	Self-management techniques including deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness techniques&bull;	An understanding of how automatic thoughts, unconscious rules / beliefs, and thinking styles contribute to anxiety&bull;	Effective communication skills&bull;	The ability to use graduated exposure to reduce symptoms of anxiety&bull;	Goal setting and follow-through&bull;	Positive coping strategies to replace negative coping strategies&bull;	Assertiveness skills (i.e., setting boundaries, constructive criticism)&bull;	Anger management techniques&bull;	An ability to cope with setbacks and plateaus Participants are expected to have begun the process of re-integrating into previous activities (i.e., employment, school, social, family, and recreational).  The program indirectly benefits the household members of the individuals who participate in the program, as they are often affected negatively by an anxiety sufferer's symptoms.Participants are provided with a copy of "The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook, 4th Edition" (Edmund J. Bourne), a copy of "Mind Over Mood" (Christine Padesky with Dennis Greenberger) as well as a Participant manual, which is produced by ADAO.

The ADAO 14-Week Anxiety Management Workshop is a structured educational workshop, the focus of which is on providing participants with tools and information to assist them in managing their symptoms of anxiety.
Each week, following a check-in activity, facilitators will guide participants through a relaxation exercise.  The focus of each session will be on information-sharing; however, the format will vary from week (e.g., group/individual activities, mini-lectures, role play exercises).  Each session ends with a grounding exercise as well as a check-out activity.  Facilitators are provided with session agendas, background reading material, presentation material, relaxation/grounding exercises, as well as participant handouts for each session.  Each session is also supplemented with a gratitude journal exercise, resource-sharing, as well as a focus on connecting participants to the community.
During the first session, participants are introduced to anxiety, the different types, and its causes.  Subsequent sessions focus on relaxation and related techniques; nutrition and physical exercise; mindfulness; and an introduction to the process of identifying and distinguishing between thoughts and feelings.  Over the course of four weeks, participants are introduced to cognitive-behaviour theory and techniques (e.g., automatic thoughts, Socratic method, cognitive distortions, assumptions and core beliefs) as well as graduated exposure, introducing participants to both the theory behind these ideas as well as the tools used to manage related symptoms of anxiety.
Sessions are also dedicated to providing participants with information and strategies to manage feelings and emotions and two weeks of classes are dedicated to issues related to anger and assertiveness.  The two final classes focus on anxiety and spirituality as well as a celebration of the progress made over the course of the 14-weeks.
Upon graduation from the program, the expectation is that participants have achieved short-term goals related to the reduction of anxiety symptoms (i.e., I'll pick up the groceries with my husband each week; I'll attend a social event twice a week).  Further, the root causes of anxiety (i.e., anxiety-provoking thinking styles) have been explored and the process of self-management taught.  Participants in the program are expected to develop:&bull;	Knowledge about anxiety conditions&bull;	An understanding of the impact of nutrition and stress on symptoms of anxiety&bull;	Self-management techniques including deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness techniques&bull;	An understanding of how automatic thoughts, unconscious rules / beliefs, and thinking styles contribute to anxiety&bull;	Effective communication skills&bull;	The ability to use graduated exposure to reduce symptoms of anxiety&bull;	Goal setting and follow-through&bull;	Positive coping strategies to replace negative coping strategies&bull;	Assertiveness skills (i.e., setting boundaries, constructive criticism)&bull;	Anger management techniques&bull;	An ability to cope with setbacks and plateaus Participants are expected to have begun the process of re-integrating into previous activities (i.e., employment, school, social, family, and recreational).  The program indirectly benefits the household members of the individuals who participate in the program, as they are often affected negatively by an anxiety sufferer's symptoms.Participants are provided with a copy of "The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook, 4th Edition" (Edmund J. Bourne), a copy of "Mind Over Mood" (Christine Padesky with Dennis Greenberger) as well as a Participant manual, which is produced by ADAO. The manual contains additional reading material as well as an agenda and outline for each session.
